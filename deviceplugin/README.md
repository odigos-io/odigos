## ðŸ“¦ `deviceplugin` â€“ Odigos Device Plugin for Kubernetes

The `deviceplugin` module provides a standalone, pluggable implementation of a **Kubernetes device plugin**, purpose-built for the [Odigos](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos) observability platform.

It is responsible for exposing **instrumentation-related virtual devices** to Kubernetes nodes. These devices enable automatic runtime configuration of applications by mounting required files and injecting OpenTelemetry environment variables.
