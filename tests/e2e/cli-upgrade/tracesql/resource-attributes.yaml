description: |
  This test check the following resource attributes:
  A. odigos.version attribute exists on all spans, since it's an upgrade, we can have version of both the old and new odigos deployments.
  B. Kubernetes attributes are correctly set on all spans
  At the time of writing this test, TraceQL api does not support not equal to nil so we use regex instead.
