# Workload Lifecycle

This e2e test verify various scenarios related to the lifecycle of workloads in the cluster.

## Node.js Workloads

### nodejs-unsupported-version

- Node.js version 8 (minimum support version is 14)
- NODE_VERSION environment variable set in the image - detected by runtime inspection
- Should not be instrumented

### nodejs-very-old-version

- Node.js version 8 (minimum support version is 14)
- NODE_VERSION environment variable NOT set in the image - runtime version not detected by runtime inspection
- Instrumentation device should be added, but agent should not load

### nodejs-minimum-version

- Node.js version 14.0.0 (minimum supported version)
- NODE_VERSION environment variable set in the image - detected by runtime inspection
- Instrumentation device should be added, agent should load and report traces correctly.
- This workload verifies that we support the minimum version we claim.

### nodejs-latest-version

- Node.js version with label `current` from dockerhub
- NODE_VERSION environment variable set in the image - detected by runtime inspection
- Instrumentation device should be added, agent should load and report traces correctly
- This workload checks if something in the latest version of nodejs broke the agent.

### nodejs-docker-env

- Node.js version `20.17.0` (common version)
- Application uses NODE_OPTIONS environment variable in the dockerfile to set one `--require` flag and another `--max-old-space-size` flag.
- This workload verifies that after instrumentation is applied, those 2 options still works as expected.

### nodejs-manifest-env

- Node.js version `20.17.0` (common version)
- Application uses NODE_OPTIONS environment variable in the k8s deployment manifest to set one `--require` flag and another `--max-old-space-size` flag.
- This workload verifies that after instrumentation is applied, those 2 options still works as expected.

## Java Workloads

### java-supported-version

- Java version 17 (minimum support version is 8)
- NODE_VERSION environment variable set in the image - detected by runtime inspection
- Should not be instrumented

### java-latest-version

- Java latest version (minimum support version is 8)
- This workload verifies that we support the latest version of Java

### java-old-version

- Java version 11 (minimum support version is 8)
- Instrumentation device should be added, agent should load and report traces correctly.
- This workload verifies that we support the old versions.

### java-azul

- Java version 17 (minimum support version is 8)
- This workload checks a special JRE named Azul, which specialize at low-latency and high-throughput applications.

### java-supported-docker-env

- Java version 17 (minimum support version is 8)
- Application uses JAVA_OPTS environment variable in the dockerfile.
- This workload verifies that after instrumentation is applied, those 2 options still works as expected.

### java-supported-manifest-env

- Java version 17 (minimum support version is 8)
- Application uses JAVA_OPTS environment variable in the k8s deployment manifest.
- This workload verifies that after instrumentation is applied, those 2 options still works as expected.

## Python Workloads

### python-latest-version
- Runs on the latest Python version.
- The instrumentation device should be added, and the agent must load and report traces as expected.
- We ensure that odigos-opentelemetry-python does not conflict with or overwrite the application's dependencies.

### python-alpine
- Runs Python 3.10 on the Alpine Linux distribution.
- The instrumentation device should be added, and the agent must load and report traces as expected.
- We ensure that odigos-opentelemetry-python does not conflict with or overwrite the application's dependencies.
- The application utilizes the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable in the Kubernetes deployment manifest.

### python-minimum-supported-version
- Runs Python 3.8 (minimum supported version).
- The instrumentation device should be added, and the agent must load and report traces as expected.
- We ensure that odigos-opentelemetry-python does not conflict with or overwrite the application's dependencies.

### python-not-supported-version
- Runs Python 3.6.
- This version is not supported for instrumentation.
- We ensure that odigos-opentelemetry-python does not conflict with or overwrite the application's dependencies.

## CPP Workloads

- Workload with a language odigos does not support.
- Should not be instrumented or restarted.

## Multi Language Workloads

### language-change

A workload that starts as nodejs in step 1 and changes to cpp (unknown in odigos) in step 2.
This is not very realistic, but it's a way to test if odigos can handle a change in the workload language.
Since the runtime detection mechanism is not bullet-proof, we can't guarantee that the detected language will not modify from known to unknown and vice-versa.
In case we run into this scenario, we should be able to handle it gracefully.

It would be best to simulate a more realistic scenario where the workload still runs nodejs but it is not detected. however, this is more complex and is left for future improvements.

## Steps

## Step 01 - Deploy Initial Workloads and Instrumentation

Adds the initial workloads, instrument the ns and add destination to odigos.
Verify the expected state for each workload according to it's caracteristics.

- nodejs-unsupported-version
  - detect the runtime version
  - avoid adding instrumentation device
- nodejs-very-old-version
  - should NOT detect the runtime version
  - should add instrumentation device for unknown runtime version
  - should not create instrumentation instance
  - agent should not load
- nodejs-minimum-version
  - should detect the runtime version
  - should add instrumentation device
  - should report health in the instrumented instance CR
  - agent should load and report traces
- nodejs-latest-version - should detect the runtime version and add instrumentation device, and report success in the instrumented instance CR.
  - should detect the runtime version
  - should add instrumentation device
  - should report health in the instrumented instance CR
  - agent should load and report traces
- nodejs-docker-env
  - should detect the runtime version and NODE_OPTIONS value from container env
  - should add instrumentation device and patch the NODE_OPTIONS value
  - should report health in the instrumented instance CR
  - agent should load and report traces, and verify the `--require` script is loaded correctly and the `--max-old-space-size` is in effect in v8 runtime.
- nodejs-manifest-env
  - should detect the runtime version and NODE_OPTIONS value from container env
  - should add instrumentation device and patch the NODE_OPTIONS value
  - should report health in the instrumented instance CR
  - agent should load and report traces, and verify the `--require` script is loaded correctly and the `--max-old-space-size` is in effect in v8 runtime.
- cpp-http-server
  - should NOT detect the runtime language and report it as `unknown`
  - should NOT add instrumentation device
- language-change
  - should detect the runtime version
  - should add instrumentation device
  - should report health in the instrumented instance CR
  - agent should load and report traces

## Step 02 - Update Workload Manifest

This steps will make a change in the workload manifests and make sure that after the new revision, the applications are running, instrumented and produce traces.

- nodejs-unsupported-version
  - deployment manifest should be patched by odigos
  - workload should not restart due to odigos
- nodejs-very-old-version
  - should reinject the instrumentation device as runtime version not available
  - process should restart and agent should not load
- nodejs-minimum-version
  - deployment manifest should be patched by odigos
  - workload should restart and agent should load
  - it should report traces
- nodejs-latest-version
  - deployment manifest should be patched by odigos
  - workload should restart and agent should load
  - it should report traces
- nodejs-docker-env
  - deployment manifest should be patched by odigos, both instrumentation device and NODE_OPTIONS env
  - workload should restart and agent should load
  - it should report traces
- nodejs-manifest-env
  - deployment manifest should be patched by odigos, both instrumentation device and NODE_OPTIONS env
  - workload should restart and agent should load
  - it should report traces
- cpp-http-server
  - deployment manifest should be patched by odigos
  - workload should not restart and agent should not load
- language-change
  - deployment should revert the instrumentation device
  - deployment should revert the injected env vars
  - deployment should remove the env override annotation
