                      This option sets the limit on the memory usage of the collector.
                      since the memory limiter mechanism is heuristic, and operates on fixed intervals,
                      while it cannot fully prevent OOMs, it can help in reducing the chances of OOMs in edge cases.
                      the settings should prevent the collector from exceeding the memory request,
                      so one can set this to the same value as the memory request or higher to allow for some buffer for bursts.

                    description: |-
                      this parameter sets the "limit_mib" parameter in the memory limiter configuration for the collector.
                      it is the hard limit after which a force garbage collection will be performed.
                      this value will end up comparing against the go runtime reported heap Alloc value.
                      According to the memory limiter docs:
                      > Note that typically the total memory usage of process will be about 50MiB higher than this value
                      a test from nov 2024 showed that fresh odigos collector with no traffic takes 38MiB,
                      thus the 50MiB is a good value to start with.

                  memoryLimiterSpikeLimitMiB:
                    description: |-
                      this parameter sets the "spike_limit_mib" parameter in the memory limiter configuration for the collector memory limiter.
                      note that this is not the processor soft limit itself, but the diff in Mib between the hard limit and the soft limit.
                      according to the memory limiter docs, it is recommended to set this to 20% of the hard limit.
                      changing this value allows trade-offs between memory usage and resiliency to bursts.
