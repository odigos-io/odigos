                  ServicesNameFilters defines rules for sampling traces based on the presence
                  of specific service names. If a trace contains a span from one of the listed
                  services, the associated sampling ratio is applied.

                        FallbackSamplingRatio is the percentage (0–100) of traces to sample

                        SamplingRatio determines the percentage (0–100) of traces to sample
                        when the specified service is present in the trace.

                        For example, a value of 100 means all such traces will be kept,
                        while a value of 0 means all will be dropped.
