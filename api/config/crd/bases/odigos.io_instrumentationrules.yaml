                    PodWorkload represents the higher-level controller managing a specific Pod within a Kubernetes cluster.
                    It contains essential details about the controller such as its Name, Namespace, and Kind.
                    'Kind' refers to the type of controller, which can be a Deployment, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet.
                    This struct is useful for identifying and interacting with the overarching entity
                    that governs the lifecycle and behavior of a Pod, especially in contexts where
                    understanding the relationship between a Pod and its controlling workload is crucial.
