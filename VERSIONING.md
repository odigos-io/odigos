# Versioning

Odigos publishes 2 release types:
-  stable releases (`v1.0.X`)
-  release candidates (`v1.0.x-rcY`)

Stable releases are the default and recommended version to install. Release candidates are opt-in and require the user to explicitly take an action to install them.

## Release Process

### Stable Release Process

The “next stable” version is currently defined as the latest version with its patch number increased by one.
(In the future, this definition will change to follow proper semantic versioning.)

A stable version is a release candidate that has successfully completed the release‑candidate process and is then promoted to stable.

### Release Candidate Process

Before releasing a new stable version, we release a new "release candidate" (rc) version. This allows the odigos team to test and validate the new version, and for the community to pull in latest bug fixes and features and provide feedback.

If any bugs are found in the release candidate, they should be fixed and a new release candidate should be released with the "rc" suffix incremented by 1.

After a release candidate is tested and validated, it is promoted to a stable release.

Release candidates are always made against the next stable version, with the "-rcY" suffix, where Y is the release candidate number, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 on every new release candidate to the same stable release version.

## Consuming Odigos Versions

Odigos should always default to using a stable version for any installation method. The instllation options are mentioned in [the docs](https://docs.odigos.io/setup/installation).

To install a release candidate version, one needs to "hop-in" to the release candidate version.

- **brew** - use the "rc" tap (`homebrew-odigos-cli-rc/odigos`) which is not the default tap. this will always install the latest release candidate version. **Notice**, the tap for stable releases is `homebrew-odigos-cli/odigos`, so pay attention to the tap name and the version you are using to avoid installing the wrong version.

```bash
brew update && brew install odigos-io/homebrew-odigos-cli-rc/odigos
```

- **helm repo** - release candidates are published to the same repo and are ignored by helm by default. to install a release candidate, first `helm repo update` then use `--version` flag to specify the release candidate version.

```bash
helm repo add odigos https://odigos-io.github.io/odigos
helm repo update
helm install odigos odigos/odigos --version v1.0.X-rcY
```

- **cli binray** - browse to https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/releases and download the cli binary for the specific release candidate version.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/releases/download/v1.0.X-rcY/cli_1.0.X-rcY_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o odigos.tar.gz
tar -xzf odigos.tar.gz
chmod +x odigos
./odigos version
```

- **helm chart** - download the latest release candidate version from the [github releases](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/releases) page and install it with `helm install odigos odigos-1.0.X-rcY.tgz`

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/releases/download/v1.0.X-rcY/helm-chart-odigos-1.0.X-rcY.tgz -o odigos-1.0.X-rcY.tgz
helm install odigos odigos-1.0.X-rcY.tgz
```

- **cli image** - pull the cli image from the registry with the specific "-rcY" version tag.

```bash
docker run --rm -it registry.odigos.io/odigos-cli:v1.0.X-rcY version
```
