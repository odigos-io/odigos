## Internal Telemetry

The following telemetry is emitted by this component.

### otelcol_ebpf_lost_samples

The number of samples lost while reading from the eBPF perf buffer. For the ring buffer, this value is always 0.

| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type | Monotonic |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| {samples} | Sum | Int | true |

### otelcol_ebpf_memory_pressure_wait_time_total

Total time spent waiting due to memory pressure. Can be compared with otelcol_process_uptime_seconds_total to calculate the percentage of time spent in memory pressure: (ebpf_memory_pressure_wait_time_total_milliseconds / (otelcol_process_uptime_seconds_total * 1000)) * 100

| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type | Monotonic |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ms | Sum | Int | true |
