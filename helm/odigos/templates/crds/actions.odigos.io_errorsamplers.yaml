          ErrorSampler is the Schema for the ErrorSampler CRD.
          It defines sampling logic that always retains traces with errors, and optionally samples
          non-error traces based on the fallback ratio.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

              ErrorSamplerSpec defines the configuration for an ErrorSampler action.
              This sampler prioritizes traces that contain errors, and allows specifying a fallback sampling ratio
              for traces that do not include any errors.
            properties:
              actionName:
                description: |-
                  ActionName is an optional identifier for this sampler rule.
                  It can be used for referencing, labeling, or displaying the rule in UIs.

              disabled:
                description: |-
                  Disabled indicates whether the sampler is currently active.
                  When true, the sampler will not be evaluated or applied.

              fallback_sampling_ratio:
                description: |-
                  FallbackSamplingRatio determines the percentage (0â€“100) of non-error traces
                  that should be sampled. Error traces are always sampled.

              ErrorSamplerStatus defines the runtime state and observed conditions of an ErrorSampler.
              It may include conditions such as "Available" or "Progressing".

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        with respect to the current state of the instance.
