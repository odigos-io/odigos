spec:
  # This PDB protects the odigos-gateway collector, which is critical for trace delivery.
  # It ensures at least one gateway pod is always available during voluntary disruptions (e.g., node drains, upgrades).
  # It is safe to install even if the gateway deployment does not exist yet â€” it becomes active once matching pods are running.
