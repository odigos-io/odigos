      - If the log group and/or log stream are specified in an EMF log, that EMF log will be exported to that log group and/or log stream (i.e. ignores the log group and log stream defined in the configuration).
        - The log group and log stream will also be created automatically if they do not already exist.
        - Example of an EMF log with log group and log stream:
        ```json
        {
          "_aws": {
            "Timestamp": 1574109732004,
