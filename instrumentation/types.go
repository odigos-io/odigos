//
// ProcessDetails can contain details that associates a process to a group of processes that are managed together by the hosting platform.
// It may include different information depending on the platform (Kubernetes, VM, etc).
//
// For example consider an app which is launched by a bash script, the script launches a python process.
// The process may create different child processes, and the bash script may launch multiple python processes.
// In this case, the process group may include the bash script, the python process, and the child processes.

// Another category of information that may be included relates to language and runtime information which can be used to
// determine the OTel distribution to use.
