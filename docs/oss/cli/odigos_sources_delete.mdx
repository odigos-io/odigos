Delete Odigos Sources

### Synopsis

This command will delete the named Source object or any Source objects that match the provided Workload info.
If a [name] is provided, that Source object will be deleted in the given namespace using the --namespace (-n) flag.

```
odigos sources delete [name] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
For example, to delete the Source named "mysource-abc123" in namespace "myapp", run:

$ odigos sources delete mysource-abc123 -n myapp

Multiple Source objects can be deleted at once using the --workload-name, --workload-kind, and --workload-namespace flags.
These flags are AND-ed so that if any of these flags are provided, all Sources that match the given flags will be deleted.

For example, to delete all Sources for StatefulSet workloads in the cluster, run:

$ odigos sources delete --workload-kind=StatefulSet --all-namespaces

To delete all Deployment Sources in namespace Foobar, run:

$ odigos sources delete --workload-kind=Deployment --workload-namespace=Foobar

or

$ odigos sources delete --workload-kind=Deployment -n Foobar

These flags can be used to batch delete Sources, or as an alternative to deleting a Source by name (for instance, when
the name of the Source might not be known, but the Workload information is known). For example:

$ odigos sources delete --workload-kind=Deployment --workload-name=myapp -n myapp-namespace

This command will delete any Sources in the namespace "myapp-namespace" that instrument a Deployment named "myapp"

It is important to note that if a Source [name] is provided, all --workload-* flags will be ignored to delete only the named Source.

```
