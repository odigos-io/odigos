Chronosphere is a monitoring and observability platform that provides a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective way to collect, store, and analyze metrics and traces.
To send data from Odigos to Chronosphere, [you need to have an account with Chronosphere](https://chronosphere.io/demo-request/) and configure the Chronosphere destination in Odigos with the following details:

- **Chronosphere Company Domain** - Your company domain can be found in the URL of the Chronosphere UI. 
For example, if your URL is `https://demo-sandbox.chronosphere.io/`, then your company domain is `demo-sandbox`. 

- **API Token** - To create your API token for sending data from odigos to Chronosphere, you should login to your Chronosphere admin account click the `Platform` menu on the left side of the screen, then click `Service Accounts` and create a new service account.

## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `Chronosphere` and follow the on-screen instructions.

2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: chronosphere-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    CHRONOSPHERE_DOMAIN: <Chronosphere Company Domain>
