### Configuring Destination Fields

<Accordion title="Supported Signals:">
  ‚ùå Traces
  ‚ùå Metrics
  ‚úÖ Logs
</Accordion>

- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME** `string` : Log Group Name. The group name of the CloudWatch Logs. If it does not exist it will be created automatically.
  - This field is required
- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_STREAM_NAME** `string` : Log Stream Name. The stream name of the CloudWatch Logs. If it does not exist it will be created automatically.
  - This field is required
- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_REGION** `string` : Region. The AWS region where the log stream is in. Region must be specified if it is not already set in the default credential chain.
  - This field is optional
- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_ENDPOINT** `string` : Endpoint. The CloudWatch Logs service endpoint which the requests are forwarded to.
  - This field is optional
- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_RETENTION** `string` : Log Retention. LogRetention is the option to set the log retention policy for only newly created CloudWatch Log Groups. The value is in days, 0 = Never Expire. This value can also be changed later-on via the AWS console (UI) or AWS API, it's not a permanent decision once set. Also, the value here might not reflect the actual retention value in the destination if it was modified or some automatic policy is applied.
  - This field is optional and defaults to `0`
- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_TAGS** `{ key: string; value: string; }[]` : Tags. Tags is the option to set tags for the CloudWatch Log Group. If specified, please add at most 50 tags. Keys must be between 1-128 characters and follow the pattern: (alphanumerics, whitespace, and _.:/=+-!). Values must be between 1-256 characters and follow the pattern: (alphanumerics, whitespace, and _.:/=+-!).
  - This field is optional
- **AWS_CLOUDWATCH_RAW_LOG** `boolean` : Raw Log. If set to true, only the log message will be exported to CloudWatch Logs. This needs to be set to true for EMF logs.
  - This field is optional and defaults to `False`

<Note>
  - If the log group and/or log stream are specified in an EMF log, that EMF log will be exported to that log group and/or log stream (i.e. ignores the log group and log stream defined in the configuration).
    - The log group and log stream will also be created automatically if they do not already exist.
    - Example of an EMF log with log group and log stream:
    ```json
    {
      "_aws": {
        "Timestamp": 1574109732004,
        "LogGroupName": "Foo",
        "LogStreamName": "Bar",
        "CloudWatchMetrics": [
          {
            "Namespace": "MyApp",
            "Dimensions": [
              [
                "Operation"
              ]
            ],
            "Metrics": [
              {
                "Name": "ProcessingLatency",
                "Unit": "Milliseconds",
                "StorageResolution": 60
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "Operation": "Aggregator",
      "ProcessingLatency": 100
    }
    ```
  - Resource ARNs (Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS resource running the collector) are currently not supported with the CloudWatch Logs Exporter.
</Note>

### Adding Destination to Odigos

There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

##### **Using the UI**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Use the [Odigos CLI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui) to access the UI
    ```bash
    odigos ui
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on `Add Destination`, select `AWS CloudWatch` and follow the on-screen instructions
  </Step>
</Steps>

##### **Using Kubernetes manifests**

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Save the YAML below to a file (e.g. `cloudwatch.yaml`)
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Destination
    metadata:
      name: cloudwatch-example
      namespace: odigos-system
    spec:
      data:
        AWS_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME: <Log Group Name>
        AWS_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_STREAM_NAME: <Log Stream Name>
        # Note: The commented fields below are optional.
        # AWS_CLOUDWATCH_REGION: <Region (options: [af-south-1, ap-east-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-northeast-2, ap-northeast-3, ap-south-1, ap-south-2, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-southeast-3, ap-southeast-4, ap-southeast-5, ap-southeast-7, ca-central-1, ca-west-1, eu-central-1, eu-central-2, eu-north-1, eu-south-1, eu-south-2, eu-west-1, eu-west-2, eu-west-3, il-central-1, me-central-1, me-south-1, mx-central-1, sa-east-1, us-east-1, us-east-2, us-gov-east-1, us-gov-west-1, us-west-1, us-west-2])>
