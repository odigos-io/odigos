## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**

Use the [Odigos CLI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui) to access the UI:

```bash
odigos ui
```

2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: dash0-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    DASH0_ENDPOINT: <Dash0 OTLP gRPC Endpoint>
  destinationName: dash0
  secretRef:
    name: dash0-secret
  signals:
  - TRACES
  - METRICS
  - LOGS
  type: dash0
