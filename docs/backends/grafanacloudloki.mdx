You can use Grafana Cloud managed service as a backend for Odigos to store your logs, metrics, and traces. 
This page describes how to configure Odigos to use Grafana Cloud Loki as a **logs** backend.

Notice: these instructions are for the Grafan cloud **managed** Loki service. 
If you run a self hosted Loki instance, please follow the instructions in the [Loki](/backends/loki) page.

All the connection details can be found at [grafana.com](grafana.com) under **My Account**

### Connection Settings

To send logs to Grafana Cloud Loki, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Endpoint** - This is the URL of the Loki service. 
You can find it in grafana ui loki page as "https://logs-prod-{REGION/SHARD}.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push" or similar.
- **Username** - You can find the loki username in the "Grafana Data Source settings" section as "User" value. 
The username is a number.
- **Password** - This field is refered to as "password" or "Grafana.com API Token" in the Grafana Cloud UI. 
You can manage tokens in your "Account Settings" page under the "SECURITY" section in the "Access Policies" page.
Make sure your token scope includes "logs:write" scope.

### Loki Labels

Loki labels are used to index logs and make them searchable in the Grafana UI. You can read more about them [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/).

You can configure your grafana cloud loki labels in the `Labels` multi-input config option in the destination page in the Odigos UI.

- Labels should be names of attribute keys that you want to index, for example: `"k8s.namespace.name"`.
- To avoid performance issues, it is recommended to limit the number of labels to a reasonable amount.
- [Use only low cardinality values](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/#cardinality). e.g. use only opentelemetry attributes for which you expect a small number of unique values.
- If the label is not present in a log record, it will be ignored.
- The default labels if not set are: `k8s.container.name, k8s.pod.name, k8s.namespace.name`
