title: "OTLP gRPC"
---

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines, Odigos support sending data to any OTLP gRPC unencrypted endpoint.

- Notice that if your backend expects [OTLP over http](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/#configuration-options) you should use the [OTLP http](/backends/otlphttp) destination instead.
- If your backedn is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

<Tip>
  Can't find your backend in Odigos? Please tell us! We are constantly
  adding new integrations.

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the endpoint of the OTLP gRPC server. Note that odigos only supports unencrypted endpoints (no tls).

The endpoint format is `host:port`. 
- host is required
- port is optional and defaults to the default OTLP gRPC port `4317`.


## Deploying using yaml

### Applying the Configuration
Save the below YAML to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using kubectl:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```
Optional fields are commented out; be sure to uncomment any relevant fields before applying.


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: otlp-example
  namespace: <odigos namespace>
spec:
  data:
    OTLP_GRPC_ENDPOINT: <OTLP gRPC Endpoint>
  destinationName: otlp
  signals:
  - TRACES
  - METRICS
  - LOGS
  type: otlp
```
