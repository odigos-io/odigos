title: "OTLP gRPC"
---

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines, Odigos support sending data to any OTLP gRPC unencrypted endpoint.

- Notice that if your backend expects [OTLP over http](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/#configuration-options) you should use the [OTLP http](/backends/otlphttp) destination instead.
- If your backedn is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

<Tip>
  Can't find your backend in Odigos? Please tell us! We are constantly
  adding new integrations.

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the endpoint of the OTLP gRPC server. Note that odigos only supports unencrypted endpoints (no tls).

The endpoint format is `host:port`. 
- host is required
- port is optional and defaults to the default OTLP gRPC port `4317`.


## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `OTLP gRPC` and follow the on-screen instructions.



2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: otlp-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    OTLP_GRPC_ENDPOINT: <OTLP gRPC Endpoint>
  destinationName: otlp
  signals:
  - TRACES
  - METRICS
  - LOGS
  type: otlp
```
