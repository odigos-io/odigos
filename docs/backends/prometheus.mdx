## Enabling Remote Write in Prometheus

Currently, Odigos supports Prometheus via the Remote Write API.
In order to enable remote write in Prometheus, set [the following feature flag](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#remote-write-receiver).

## Configuring the Prometheus Backend

Once the remote write API is enabled, you can configure the Prometheus backend in the Odigos UI.
Enter the URL of the Prometheus server and give a name to the backend.


## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `Prometheus` and follow the on-screen instructions.



2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: prometheus-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    PROMETHEUS_REMOTEWRITE_URL: <Remote Write URL>
  destinationName: prometheus
  signals:
  - METRICS
  type: prometheus
```
