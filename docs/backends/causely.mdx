## Configuring the Causely Backend

To complete adding a new Causely backend, input the following information into the Odigos UI

### Causely Destination Settings

To send Metrics/Traces to Causely, you need to configure the Causely URL in the Odigos UI.
This destination is for the Causely Mediator Service, so you will need to have a Causely instance running and accessible from the k8s cluster running odigos.

#### Endpoint

The endpoint URL is the combined `<protocol>://<hostname>:<port>` to access your Causely Mediator service.

- Protocol should be `http`; using `https` or omitting it will automatically be converted to `http`
- Hostname should typically follow the format: `mediator.<namespace>`
    - `namespace` is the k8s namespace where the Causely Mediator service is deployed
- Default port is `4317`; if no port is specified, it will be appended automatically

Example: `http://mediator.causely:4317`


## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `Causely` and follow the on-screen instructions.



2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: causely-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    CAUSELY_URL: <Endpoint>
  destinationName: causely
  signals:
  - TRACES
  - METRICS
  type: causely
```
