title: "Loki"
---

This destination is for self hosted loki instances.

If you use grafana cloud managed loki, follow the instructions in the [Grafana Cloud Loki](/backends/grafanacloudloki) page.

## Configuring the Loki Destination

In order to add a new loki destination, insert the loki backend URL into Odigos UI.

### Connection Settings

To send logs to Loki, you need to configure the Loki URL in the Odigos UI. 
This destination is for self hosted Loki instances, so you will need to have a Loki instance running and accessible from the k8s cluster running odigos.

The URL should be in the format `http://<loki-host>:<loki-port>/loki/api/v1/push`.

- If scheme is not provided, it defaults to `http`.
- If port is not provided, it defaults to `3100`.
- If path is not provided, it defaults to `/loki/api/v1/push`.

### Loki Labels

Loki labels are used to "index" logs and allow efficent filtering in the Grafana UI. You can read more about them [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/).

You can configure your grafana cloud loki labels in the `Labels` multi-input config option in the destination page in the Odigos UI.

- Labels should be names of opentelemetry resource attribute or log record attribute keys that you want to index, for example: `"k8s.namespace.name"`.
- To avoid performance issues, it is recommended to limit the number of labels to a reasonable amount.
- [Use only low cardinality values](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/labels/#cardinality). e.g. use only opentelemetry attributes for which you expect a small number of unique values like `http.response.status_code` but **not** `network.peer.address`.
- If the label is not present in a log record, it will be ignored.
- The default labels if not set are: `k8s.container.name, k8s.pod.name, k8s.namespace.name`


## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `Loki` and follow the on-screen instructions.



2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: loki-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    LOKI_LABELS: <Labels>
    LOKI_URL: <Endpoint>
  destinationName: loki
  signals:
  - LOGS
  type: loki
```
