title: "OTLP http"
---

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines, Odigos support sending data to any OTLP http endpoint.

- Notice that if your backend expects [OTLP over gRPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/#configuration-options) you should use the [OTLP gRPC](/backends/otlp) destination instead.
- If your backend is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

  adding new integrations.

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the endpoint of the OTLP gRPC server.

The endpoint format is `http://host:port`.
- host is required
- port is optional and defaults to the port of the scheme (`80` / `443`). OTLP/HTTP sometimes uses port `4318`, in which case it should be specified.
- the signal path (e.g. `/v1/traces` / `/v1/metrics` / `/v1/logs`) is added automatically and should not be included in the endpoint.

### Using Basic Authentication

This section is relevant if your OTLP http endpoint requires [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) (username and password).

To configure basic authentication, use the optional config options `Basic Auth Username` and `Basic Auth Password`.


## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `OTLP http` and follow the on-screen instructions.


2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: otlphttp-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT: <OTLP http Endpoint>
    # OTLP_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME: <Basic Auth Username>
    # Note: The commented fields above are optional.
  destinationName: otlphttp
  # Uncomment the secretRef below if you are using the optional Secret.
  # secretRef:
  #   name: otlphttp-secret

  signals:
  - TRACES
  - METRICS
  - LOGS
  type: otlphttp

---
# The following Secret is optional. Uncomment the entire block if you need to use it.
# apiVersion: v1
# data:
#   OTLP_HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD: <base64 Basic Auth Password>
# kind: Secret
# metadata:
#   name: otlphttp-secret
#   namespace: odigos-system
# type: Opaque
```
