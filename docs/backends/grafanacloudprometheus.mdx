title: "Grafana Cloud Prometheus"

You can use Grafana Cloud managed service as a backend for Odigos to store your logs, metrics, and traces. 
This page describes how to configure Odigos to use Grafana Cloud Prometheus as a **metrics** backend.

Notice: these instructions are for the Grafan cloud **managed** Prometheus service. 
If you run a self hosted Prometheus instance, please follow the instructions in the [Prometheus](/backends/prometheus) page.

All the connection details can be found at [grafana.com](https://grafana.com) under **My Account**

### Connection Settings

To send metrics to Grafana Cloud Prometheus, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Prometheus Remote Write Endpoint** - This is the URL of the Prometheus service. 
From the grafana cloud UI, Prometheus page, make sure you copy the URL from "Remote Write Endpoint" section,
and not the first Endpoint which is used for queries.
This url should look like: `https://{hostname}.grafana.net/api/prom/push` (path should be `/api/prom/push`)
- **Username / Instance ID** - You can find the prometheus page.
The username is a number.
- **Password** - This field is refered to as "password" or "Grafana.com API Token" in the Grafana Cloud UI. 
You can manage tokens in your "Account Settings" page under the "SECURITY" section in the "Access Policies" page.
Make sure your token scope includes "metrics:write" scope.

### Resource Attributes as Metrics Labels

To use [resource attributes as labels in your data points](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter#setting-resource-attributes-as-metric-labels),
you can set the resource attribute names in the `Resource Attributes as Labels` multi-input config option in the destination page in the Odigos UI. 

### Cluster Static Labels

You can set static labels for each metric data pointsent exported to Grafana Cloud Prometheus from the cluster by setting the `External Labels` configuration with lable keys and values.


## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `Grafana Cloud Prometheus` and follow the on-screen instructions.



2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: grafanacloudprometheus-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data:
    GRAFANA_CLOUD_PROMETHEUS_RW_ENDPOINT: <Prometheus Remote Write Endpoint>
    # PROMETHEUS_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES_LABELS: <Resource Attributes Labels>
    # PROMETHEUS_RESOURCE_EXTERNAL_LABELS: <External Labels>
    # Note: The commented fields above are optional.
    GRAFANA_CLOUD_PROMETHEUS_USERNAME: <Username / Instance ID>
  destinationName: grafanacloudprometheus
  secretRef:
    name: grafanacloudprometheus-secret
  signals:
  - METRICS
  type: grafanacloudprometheus

apiVersion: v1
data:
  GRAFANA_CLOUD_PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD: <base64 Password / Api Token>
kind: Secret

  namespace: odigos-system
