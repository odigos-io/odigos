Odigos currently supports Standard (non-Autopilot) GKE clusters.
Exporting into Google Cloud does not require credentials as the Kubernetes nodes are permissioned to access the Google Cloud Monitoring APIs by default.

## Adding a Destination to Odigos

Odigos makes it simple to add and configure destinations, allowing you to select the specific signals [traces/logs/metrics] that you want to send to each destination. There are two primary methods for configuring destinations in Odigos:

1. **Using the UI**  
   To add a destination via the UI, follow these steps:
   - Use the Odigos CLI to access the UI: [Odigos UI](https://docs.odigos.io/cli/odigos_ui)
   ```bash
   odigos ui
    ```
- In the left sidebar, navigate to the `Destination` page.

- Click `Add New Destination`

- Select `Google Cloud Monitoring` and follow the on-screen instructions.


2. **Using kubernetes manifests**

Save the YAML below to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination.yaml
```


```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: googlecloud-example
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  data: {}
  destinationName: googlecloud
  signals:
  - TRACES
  - LOGS
  type: googlecloud
```
