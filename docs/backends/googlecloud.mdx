title: "Google Cloud Monitoring"
---

Odigos currently supports Standard (non-Autopilot) GKE clusters.
Exporting into Google Cloud does not require credentials as the Kubernetes nodes are permissioned to access the Google Cloud Monitoring APIs by default.


## Deploying using yaml

### Applying the Configuration
Save the below YAML to a file (e.g., `destination.yaml`) and apply it using kubectl:
