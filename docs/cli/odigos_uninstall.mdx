## odigos uninstall

Revert all the changes made by the `odigos install` command.
This command will uninstall Odigos from your cluster. It will delete all Odigos objects
and rollback any metadata changes made to your objects.
 
Note: Namespaces created during Odigos CLI installation will be deleted during uninstallation. This applies only to CLI installs, not Helm.
