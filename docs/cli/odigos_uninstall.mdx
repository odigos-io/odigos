## odigos uninstall

Revert all the changes made by the `odigos install` command.
This command will uninstall Odigos from your cluster. It will delete all Odigos objects
and rollback any metadata changes made to your objects.
 
Note: Namespaces created during Odigos CLI installation will be deleted during uninstallation. This applies only to CLI installs, not Helm.

```
odigos uninstall [flags]
```

### Examples

```

# Uninstall Odigos open-source or cloud from the cluster in your kubeconfig active context.
odigos uninstall

# Uninstall Odigos without confirmation
odigos uninstall --yes

# Uninstall Odigos without waiting for pods to rollout without instrumentation
odigos uninstall --no-wait

# Uninstall Odigos cloud from a specific cluster
odigos uninstall --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig>

# Install a fresh setup of Odigos
odigos uninstall
odigos install

```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                   help for uninstall
      --instrumentation-only   Set to true if running inside a Kubernetes cluster (e.g. as a Helm hook job). Skips deletion of resources managed by Helm, which should be removed via 'helm uninstall'.
      --no-wait                skip waiting for pods to rollout without instrumentation
      --yes                    skip the confirmation prompt
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --kube-context string   (optional) name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --kubeconfig string     (optional) absolute path to the kubeconfig file (default "KUBECONFIG")
  -v, --verbose               enable verbose output
```
