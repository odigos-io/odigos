<Info>
  eBPF-Based Instrumentation is currently the default setting of Odigos **Open-Source** version, and is also available with the Odigos **Enterprise** plan.

  Native Instrumentation is currently not supported for this language.
</Info>

## Supported Versions

Odigos uses the official [opentelemetry-go-instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation) OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation using eBPF, thus it supports the same golang versions as this project.

- Go runtime versions **1.19** and above are supported.

<EbpfKernelVersionNote />

## Traces

Odigos will automatically instrument your golang services to record and collect spans for distributed tracing, by utilizing the OpenTelemetry Go official auto Instrumentation Libraries.

## Instrumentation Libraries

The following go modules will be auto instrumented by Odigos:

### HTTP Frameworks

- [`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin) HTTP web framework ⭐️
- [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) go standard library for http server and client

<Info>
  Please note that in order for the `http.route` parameter to be properly extracted by Go auto instrumentation, you should use Go 1.22 or above and
  declare a template handler as described in [this article](https://go.dev/blog/routing-enhancements).
</Info>

### HTTP Clients

- [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) go standard library for http server and client

### Database Clients, ORMs, and data access libraries

- [`github.com/gocql/gocql`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gocql/gocql) ⭐️ versions `>= v1.0.0`. database client library for Apache Cassandra
- [`github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8) ⭐️ versions >= v8.0.0
- [`database/sql`](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) go standard library for SQL database access

### Messaging Systems Clients

- [`github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go) ⭐️ versions `>= v1.4.0`. messaging client for RabbitMQ
- [`github.com/segmentio/kafka-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) versions `>= v0.4.1`. messaging client for Apache Kafka
- [`github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go) ⭐️ versions `>= v0.12.0`. messaging client for Apache Pulsar

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

- [`google.golang.org/grpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc) versions `>= v1.14.0`. rpc client and server for gRPC framework

Please note that modules marked with ⭐️ are available in Odigos pro only.

## About Go Offsets

Auto-instrumentation for Go with eBPF works by using eBPF uprobes to dynamically read variables in memory at runtime. For example,
when instrumenting the `net/http` package Odigos is able to determine the `http.request.method` by probing the [`Method`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request) 
field in the current `Request`.

Doing so relies on knowing the exact memory location of this field. This is known as the field's "offset" (because it refers to the field's location as a
number of bytes offset from the start of the current struct). With this information, our eBPF code can access the value directly.

However, most production Go programs do not preserve this offset information at compile time. Only Go programs compiled with [debug information](https://go.dev/doc/gdb)
will include this information by default. To work with all Go programs, Odigos ships with a precompiled list of known offsets for all currently supported
versions of instrumented libraries.

This precompiled list is updated to be up-to-date with every release of Odigos. But, this means that you may encounter errors instrumenting applications
that use very newly released versions of dependencies. If this occurs, it will be resolved by updating to the next release of Odigos, or alternatively
upgrading the locally-stored offsets with the [`odigos pro update-offsets`](/cli/odigos_pro_update-offsets) command.

### Updating Offsets Between Versions

It is possible to pull the latest Go library support for Odigos without updating the entire Odigos installation. There are 3 ways to do so:

1. Manual updates (with [`odigos pro update-offsets`](/cli/odigos_pro_update-offsets)).
2. Direct automatic updates (recommended, see below).
3. Mirrored image automatic updates (for disconnected environments, see below).

In both automatic modes, a Kubernetes CronJob is created which updates the locally stored Go library offsets used by the Odiglet. The differences
between these modes and how to enable them are described below.

#### Direct automatic updates

In "direct" mode, the CronJob will pull the latest Go library offsets directly from the Odigos cloud server and apply it to the cluster. This
option consumes the fewest resources but requires that your cluster has direct internet access to this file hosted on the web. If you have
restricted Internet egress policies, see "mirrored image updates" below.

Enable automatic updates on any standard cron schedule by setting the [`odigos config set go-auto-offsets-cron`](/cli/odigos_config) option to
any valid cron schedule. For example, enable nightly updates at midnight with `odigos config set go-auto-offsets-cron "0 0 * * *"`.

To disable automatic updates, set the cron value to an empty string with `odigos config set go-auto-offsets-cron ""`.

#### Mirrored image automatic updates

For clusters with restricted traffic policies, you have the option to [mirror the Go library updates as an image](/setup/docker-registry#install-odigos-images-from-a-custom-docker-registry).
In this mode, the CronJob will run an image that contains the latest Go library offsets bundled into the image itself. This mode
does not require direct Internet access from the cluster, but it does require you to mirror this image into your own registry and maintain
the latest version on your nodes.

To enable mirrored image updates, run `odigos config set go-auto-offsets-mode "image"`. Then use the `go-auto-offsets-cron` option described above to set the schedule.

To disable mirrored image updates, run `odigos config set go-auto-offsets-mode "direct"` (to switch back to direct mode), or set the `go-auto-offsets-cron`
setting to an empty string (`""`) as described above to disable automatic updates entirely.
