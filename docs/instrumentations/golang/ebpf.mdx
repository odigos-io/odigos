<Info>
  eBPF-Based Instrumentation is currently the default setting of Odigos **Open-Source** version, and is also available with the Odigos **Enterprise** plan.

  Native Instrumentation is currently not supported for this language.
</Info>

## Supported Versions

Odigos uses the official [opentelemetry-go-instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation) OpenTelemetry Auto Instrumentation using eBPF, thus it supports the same golang versions as this project.

- Go runtime versions **1.17** and above are supported.

<EbpfKernelVersionNote />

## Traces

Odigos will automatically instrument your golang services to record and collect spans for distributed tracing, by utilizing the OpenTelemetry Go official auto Instrumentation Libraries.

## Instrumentation Libraries

The following go modules will be auto instrumented by Odigos:

### HTTP Frameworks

- [`github.com/gin-gonic/gin`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin) HTTP web framework ⭐️
- [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) go standard library for http server and client

<Info>
  Please note that in order for the `http.route` parameter to be properly extracted by Go auto instrumentation, you should use Go 1.22 or above and
  declare a template handler as described in [this article](https://go.dev/blog/routing-enhancements).
</Info>

### HTTP Clients

- [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) go standard library for http server and client

### Database Clients, ORMs, and data access libraries

- [`github.com/gocql/gocql`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gocql/gocql) ⭐️ versions `>= v1.0.0`. database client library for Apache Cassandra
- [`github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v8) ⭐️ versions >= v8.0.0
- [`database/sql`](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) go standard library for SQL database access

### Messaging Systems Clients

- [`github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go) ⭐️ versions `>= v1.4.0`. messaging client for RabbitMQ
- [`github.com/segmentio/kafka-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) versions `>= v0.4.1`. messaging client for Apache Kafka
- [`github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go) ⭐️ versions `>= v0.12.0`. messaging client for Apache Pulsar

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

- [`google.golang.org/grpc`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc) versions `>= v1.14.0`. rpc client and server for gRPC framework

Please note that modules marked with ⭐️ are available in Odigos pro only.

## About Go Offsets

Auto-instrumentation for Go with eBPF works by using eBPF uprobes to dynamically read variables in memory at runtime. For example,
when instrumenting the `net/http` package Odigos is able to determine the `http.request.method` by probing the [`Method`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request) 
field in the current `Request`.

Doing so relies on knowing the exact memory location of this field. This is known as the field's "offset" (because it refers to the field's location as a
number of bytes offset from the start of the current struct). With this information, our eBPF code can access the value directly.

However, most production Go programs do not preserve this offset information at compile time. Only Go programs compiled with [debug information](https://go.dev/doc/gdb)
will include this information by default. To work with all Go programs, Odigos ships with a precompiled list of known offsets for all currently supported
versions of instrumented libraries.

This precompiled list is updated to be up-to-date with every release of Odigos. But, this means that you may encounter errors instrumenting applications
that use very newly released versions of dependencies. If this occurs, it will be resolved by updating to the next release of Odigos, or alternatively
upgrading the locally-stored offsets with the [`odigos pro update-offsets`](/cli/odigos_pro_update-offsets) command.
