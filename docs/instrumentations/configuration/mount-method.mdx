description: "For Odigos agents to run inside instrumented pod containers, certain files must be mounted into the container. In Kubernetes, these files are mounted under `/var/odigos` directory, with subdirectories for each agent. There are few mechanisms to achieve this, which are explained in this document."

## Mount Method

<Warning>
This section is for advanced users and odigos administrators.

It is recommended to use the default settings, unless you have specific requirements or run into an issue.
</Warning>

## Supported Mount Methods

Odigos supports 2 mount methods, which can be used depending on the user preference, cluster policies, integration with existing tools, etc.

### 1. VirtualDevice

<Info>
This is the default mount method
</Info>

#### Pod Manifest Additions

For agents and languages that requires filesystem mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- For each instrumented container in the pod spec, odigos will add a resource requirement under the `spec.containers[].resources` field:

```yaml
    resources:
      limits:
        instrumentation.odigos.io/generic: "1"
      requests:
        instrumentation.odigos.io/generic: "1"
```

#### Caveats

- May sometimes not integrate well with node auto-scaling tools like [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/).
- Odiglet daemonset needs to be running on a node for instrumented pods to be scheduled on that node.

### 2. HostPath

This method is an opt-in configuration option which can be used if the virtual device method is not suitable for your cluster.

If it is supported in the cluster, it is preferred to use over the VirtualDevice method which requires odiglet component to run.

**Enabling HostPath**

- Profile: `odigos profile add mount-method-k8s-host-path`

- Odigos CLI: `odigos config set mount-method k8s-host-path`

- Helm Chart: in your values file, set `instrumentor.mountMethod` to `k8s-host-path`, or use helm cli `--set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-host-path` flag with helm upgrade.

- Kubernetes Manifest: under the `odigos-config` ConfigMap in odigos namespace, set the value in the `mountMethod` field of `config.yaml` to `k8s-host-path`.

**Pod Manifest Additions**

For agents and languages that requires filesystem mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- Volume to the pod spec, under the `spec.volumes` field:

```yaml
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/odigos
      type: ""
    name: odigos-agent
```

- VolumeMount to the instrumented container specs, under the `spec.containers[].volumeMounts` field:

```yaml
    - mountPath: /var/odigos/{agent_sub_dir}
      name: odigos-agent
      readOnly: true
      subPath: {agent_sub_dir}
```

**Caveats**

The "HostPath" option should be enabled in the cluster. Some policy tools may block this, like: 

- [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
- [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)

If your cluster enforces such policies, you have the following options:

- Use the VirtualDevice method.
- Request the cluster administrator to whitelist the Odigos agent host path in the policy tool.
