description: "For Odigos agents to run inside instrumented pod containers, certain files must be mounted into the container. In Kubernetes, these files are mounted under `/var/odigos` directory, with subdirectories for each agent. There are few mechanisms to achieve this, which are explained in this document."

## Mount Method

<Warning>
This section is for advanced users and odigos administrators.

It is recommended to use the default settings, unless you have specific requirements or run into an issue.
</Warning>

## Supported Mount Methods

Odigos supports 4 mount methods, which can be used depending on the user preference, cluster policies, integration with existing tools, etc.

### 1. VirtualDevice

<Info>
This is the default mount method
</Info>

#### Pod Manifest Additions

For agents and languages that requires filesystem mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- For each instrumented container in the pod spec, odigos will add a resource requirement under the `spec.containers[].resources` field:

```yaml
    resources:
      limits:
        instrumentation.odigos.io/generic: "1"
      requests:
        instrumentation.odigos.io/generic: "1"
```

#### Caveats

- May sometimes not integrate well with node auto-scaling tools like [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/).
- Odiglet daemonset needs to be running on a node for instrumented pods to be scheduled on that node.

### 2. HostPath

This method is an opt-in configuration option which can be used if the virtual device method is not suitable for your cluster.

If it is supported in the cluster, it is preferred to use over the VirtualDevice method which requires odiglet component to run.

**Enabling HostPath**

- Profile: `odigos profile add mount-method-k8s-host-path`

- Odigos CLI: `odigos install --set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-host-path`

- Helm Chart: in your values file, set `instrumentor.mountMethod` to `k8s-host-path`, or use helm cli `--set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-host-path` flag with helm upgrade.

- Kubernetes Manifest: under the `odigos-configuration` ConfigMap in odigos namespace, set the value in the `mountMethod` field of `config.yaml` to `k8s-host-path`.

#### Pod Manifest Additions

For agents and languages that requires filesystem mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- Volume to the pod spec, under the `spec.volumes` field:

```yaml
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/odigos
      type: ""
    name: odigos-agent
```

- VolumeMount to the instrumented container specs, under the `spec.containers[].volumeMounts` field:

```yaml
    - mountPath: /var/odigos/{agent_sub_dir}
      name: odigos-agent
      readOnly: true
      subPath: {agent_sub_dir}
```

#### Caveats

The "HostPath" option should be enabled in the cluster. Some policy tools may block this, like:

- [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
- [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)

If your cluster enforces such policies, you have the following options:

- Use the VirtualDevice method.
- Request the cluster administrator to whitelist the Odigos agent host path in the policy tool.


### 3. InitContainer

This is an opt-in configuration method designed for scenarios where using hostPath is not feasible due to security policies or virtual device limitations.

For agents and languages that require filesystem mounts, Odigos will inject an InitContainer that copies the necessary files into a shared volume mounted by the application container.

**Enabling InitContainer**

- Odigos CLI: `odigos install --set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-init-container`
- Helm Chart: in your values file, set `instrumentor.mountMethod` to `k8s-init-container`, or use helm cli `--set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-init-container` flag with helm upgrade.
- Kubernetes Manifest: under the `odigos-configuration` ConfigMap in odigos namespace, set the value in the `mountMethod` field of `config.yaml` to `k8s-init-container`.

#### Pod Manifest Additions
Odigos will add an InitContainer that copies the necessary files for instrumentation, depending on the application language. These files will be placed into a shared volume that is also mounted by the application container.

- Volume to the pod spec, under the `spec.volumes` field:

```yaml
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/odigos
      type: ""
    name: odigos-agent
```

#### Caveats

The InitContainer method must be enabled in the cluster and introduces a slight delay during pod initialization.
This approach is ideal for users who prioritize avoiding hostPath or virtual device usage over startup speed.

### 4. CSI Driver

This is an opt-in configuration method that uses the Container Storage Interface (CSI) standard for mounting instrumentation files. It provides improved user experience over the VirtualDevice method by ensuring pods wait gracefully when the mount system isn't ready.

**Enabling CSI Driver**

- Odigos CLI: `odigos install --set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-csi-driver`
- Helm Chart: in your values file, set `instrumentor.mountMethod` to `k8s-csi-driver`, or use helm cli `--set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-csi-driver` flag with helm upgrade.
- Kubernetes Manifest: under the `odigos-configuration` ConfigMap in odigos namespace, set the value in the `mountMethod` field of `config.yaml` to `k8s-csi-driver`.

#### Pod Manifest Additions

For agents and languages that requires filesystem mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- Volume to the pod spec, under the `spec.volumes` field:

```yaml
  - name: odigos-agent
    csi:
      driver: odigos.csi.driver
      volumeAttributes:
        type: instrumentation
```

- VolumeMount to the instrumented container specs, under the `spec.containers[].volumeMounts` field:

```yaml
    - mountPath: /var/odigos/{agent_sub_dir}
      name: odigos-agent
      readOnly: true
      subPath: {agent_sub_dir}
```

#### Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: Pods wait in "Creating" state until CSI driver is ready.
- **Standard Compliance**: Uses Kubernetes CSI standard for storage integration.
- **Same Functionality**: Provides identical mount behavior as the VirtualDevice method.

#### Caveats

- Requires CSI support in the cluster (available in Kubernetes 1.13+).
- Like VirtualDevice, requires odiglet daemonset to be running on nodes for instrumented pods to be scheduled.
