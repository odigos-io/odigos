## Mount Method

For odigos agents to run in the instrumented pod containers, some files need to be mounted to the container.

In Kubernetes, these files are mounted under `/var/odigos` directory, with subdirectories for each agent.

<Warning>
This section is for advanced users and odigos administrators.

It is recommended to use the default settings, unless you have specific requirements or run into an issue.
</Warning>

## Supported Mount Methods

Odigos supports 2 mount methods, which can be used depending on the user preference, cluster policies, integration with existing tools, etc.

### HostPath

This is the default and the recommended method.

#### Pod Manifest Additions

For agents and languages that requires fs mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- Volume to the pod spec, under the `spec.volumes` field:

```yaml
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/odigos
      type: ""
    name: odigos-agent
```

- VolumeMount to the instrumented container specs, under the `spec.containers[].volumeMounts` field:

```yaml
    - mountPath: /var/odigos/{agent_sub_dir}
      name: odigos-agent
      readOnly: true
      subPath: {agent_sub_dir}
```

#### Caveats

The "host path" option should be enabled in the cluster. Some policy tools may block this option, like: 

- [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
- [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)

If your cluster enforces such policies, you have the following options:

- Use the VirtualDevice method.
- Request the cluster administrator to whitelist the Odigos agent host path in the policy tool.


### VirtualDevice

This method is useful when the `HostPath` method is blocked by cluster policies.

#### Enabling VirtualDevice

- Profile: `odigos profile add mount-method-k8s-virtual-device`

- Odigos CLI: `odigos config set mount-method mount-method-k8s-virtual-device`

- Helm Chart: in your values file, set `instrumentor.mountMethod` to `k8s-virtual-device`, or use helm cli `--set instrumentor.mountMethod=k8s-virtual-device` flag with helm upgrade.

- Kubernetes Manifest: under the `odigos-config` ConfigMap in odigos namespace, set the value in the `mountMethod` field of `config.yaml` to `k8s-virtual-device`.

#### Pod Manifest Additions

For agents and languages that requires fs mounts, odigos webhook will add the following:

- For each instrumented container in the pod spec, odigos will add a resource requirement under the `spec.containers[].resources` field:

```yaml
    resources:
      limits:
        instrumentation.odigos.io/generic: "1"
      requests:
        instrumentation.odigos.io/generic: "1"
```

### Caveats

- May sometimes not integrate well with node auto-scaling tools like [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/).
- Odiglet daemonset needs to be running on a node for instrumented pods to be scheduled on that node.
