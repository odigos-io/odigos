<Info> eBPF-Based Java Instrumentation is currently available with the Odigos Enterprise plan. Contact us for more information.</Info>

## JVM Runtime Requirements

Odigos eBPF-Based Java Instrumentation requires a Java Virtual Machine runtime version of **8** and above.

The following JVM runtimes are continuously tested and verified:

| JVM Runtime | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| OpenJDK     | 8       |
| OpenJDK     | 11      |
| OpenJDK     | 17      |
| Azul Zulu   | 8       |
| Azul Zulu   | 11      |
| Azul Zulu   | 17      |

<Info>
  Odigos enterprise data collection is done using eBPF, so Odigos requires, at minimum, platforms that have underlying Linux kernel versions of 5.4.0.
