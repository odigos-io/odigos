Odigos supports Rust applications through two distribution types:

- **rust-native**: For applications already instrumented with the OpenTelemetry Rust SDK
- **rust-community**: eBPF-based automatic instrumentation (coming soon)

## Current Status

| Feature | Status | Distribution |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Language Detection | ✅ Supported | All |
| Native SDK Integration | ✅ Supported | `rust-native` |
| Automatic Instrumentation | 🚧 In Development | `rust-community` |
| Context Propagation | ✅ With SDK | `rust-native` |

<Info>
  The **rust-native** distribution is now available for Rust applications that use the OpenTelemetry Rust SDK. 
  See the [Native SDK guide](/instrumentations/rust/native) for setup instructions.
</Info>

## Available Distributions

### rust-native (Available Now)

For Rust applications that are manually instrumented with the OpenTelemetry Rust SDK. Odigos injects the necessary OTLP endpoint environment variables, allowing your application to export telemetry through the Odigos pipeline.

**Best for:**
- Applications already using OpenTelemetry
- Teams comfortable with manual instrumentation
- Production applications requiring full control over spans

[Get started with rust-native →](/instrumentations/rust/native)

### rust-community (Coming Soon)

eBPF-based automatic instrumentation that requires no code changes. Similar to [opentelemetry-go-instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation) for Go.

**Planned support for:**
- hyper HTTP server
- axum web framework
- tonic gRPC
- reqwest HTTP client

## Language Detection

Odigos detects Rust applications by inspecting ELF binaries for `__rust_` symbols. When you enable instrumentation on a Rust workload, Odigos will:

1. Correctly identify the programming language as Rust
2. Report it in the InstrumentationConfig status
3. Display it in the Odigos UI
4. Apply the selected distribution (rust-native or rust-community)

## Quick Start with rust-native

### 1. Add Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
opentelemetry = "0.24"
opentelemetry_sdk = { version = "0.24", features = ["rt-tokio"] }
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.17", features = ["grpc-tonic"] }
```

### 2. Initialize the SDK

```rust
use opentelemetry::global;
use opentelemetry_otlp::WithExportConfig;

fn init_telemetry() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let exporter = opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter()
        .tonic()
        .with_env();  // Reads OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT from environment
    
    let provider = opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .tracing()
        .with_exporter(exporter)
        .install_batch(opentelemetry_sdk::runtime::Tokio)?;
    
    global::set_tracer_provider(provider);
    Ok(())
}
```

### 3. Enable in Odigos

When configuring your workload in Odigos, select **rust-native** as the distribution. Odigos will inject the necessary environment variables automatically.

## Future: eBPF Auto-Instrumentation

The **rust-community** distribution will bring automatic instrumentation to Rust via eBPF, similar to how Go applications are instrumented. This approach:

1. **Requires no code changes** - Instrument existing binaries without recompilation
2. **Supports stripped binaries** - Works on release builds without debug symbols
3. **Low overhead** - eBPF-based probes add minimal latency

### Planned Library Support

| Library | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| hyper | HTTP Server | 🚧 In Progress |
| axum | Web Framework | 🚧 In Progress |
| tonic | gRPC | 📋 Planned |
| reqwest | HTTP Client | 📋 Planned |
| sqlx | Database | 📋 Planned |
