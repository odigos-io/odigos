## Enrich with OpenTelemetry APIs

Odigos automatically generates data for open-source libraries and frameworks.
Additional trace spans, metrics datapoints and log records can be added using the OpenTelemetry APIs.
Odigos will automatically capture this data and deliver it to the chosen [destination](/backends-overview) alongside the automatically generated data.

<Note>
  No need to configure the OpenTelemetry SDK, Odigos will automatically configure it for you.
