## Configurable Components

- **Cluster Gateway Collector** - a collector that runs as a k8s Deployment. It receives the OpenTelemetry data from the Node Collectors, processes it, and exports it to the configured destinations.
- **Node Data Collection Collector** - a collector that runs as a k8s DaemonSet. It collects / scrape the OpenTelemetry data from the applications running on the nodes and forwards it to the Cluster Gateway Collector.

## Configuring the Pipeline

Odigos offers two main options for configuring the pipeline:

<Warning>
  When configuring the pipeline, you must use **only one of the two methods** â€” either `profiles`, or directly editing the `odigos-configuration` ConfigMap.

  Using both methods will result in configurations overwriting each other, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
</Warning>

#### 1. Using Profiles

To use profiles, you need to use the [Odigos CLI Command for Profiles](/cli/odigos_profile).<br />
This simplifies the setup process and ensures optimized settings for typical use cases.

Sizing Profiles `size_s`, `size_m`, `size_l` are pre-defined configurations designed to simplify pipeline configurations. Each profile specifies the following parameters:

**Cluster Gateway Collector**:

| Profile  | Minimum Replicas      | HPA Maximum Replicas      | Request CPU (m)      | Limit CPU (m)      | Request Memory (Mi) | Limit Memory (Mi) |
|----------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `size_s` | **1**                 | **5**                | **150m**        | **300m**      | **300Mi**            | **300Mi**         |
| `size_m` | **2**                 | **8**                | **500m**        | **1000m**     | **500Mi**            | **600Mi**         |
| `size_l` | **3**                 | **12**               | **750m**        | **1250m**     | **750Mi**            | **850Mi**        |

**Node Data Collection Collector**:

| Profile  | Request Memory (Mi)  | Limit Memory (Mi) | Request CPU (m)      | Limit CPU (m)
|----------|----------------------|-------------------| ---------------------|-------------------|
| `size_s` | **150Mi**            | **300Mi**         | **150m**             | **300m**         |
| `size_m` | **250Mi**            | **500Mi**         | **250m**             | **500m**         |
| `size_l` | **500Mi**            | **750Mi**         | **500m**             | **750m**         |

#### 2. Directly Editing the `odigos-configuration` ConfigMap

For more advanced control over the pipeline, you can directly edit the `odigos-configuration` ConfigMap. This method allows you to configure additional `collectorGateway` settings.

Editing the ConfigMap allows you to fine-tune every aspect of the pipeline to meet custom requirements. Below is an example of how to configure the `collectorGateway` parameters:

```yaml
collectorGateway:
  # MinReplicas is the number of replicas for the cluster gateway collector deployment.
  # It also sets the minReplicas for the HPA to this value.
  minReplicas: 1

  # MaxReplicas sets the maxReplicas for the HPA to this value.
  maxReplicas: 8

  # RequestMemoryMiB is the memory request for the cluster gateway collector deployment.
  # This value will be embedded in the deployment as a resource request of the form "memory: <value>Mi".
  requestMemoryMiB: 500

  # LimitMemoryMiB is the memory limit for the cluster gateway collector deployment.
  # This value will be embedded in the deployment as a resource limit of the form "memory: <value>Mi".
  limitMemoryMiB: 625

  # RequestCPUm is the CPU request for the cluster gateway collector deployment.
  # This value will be embedded in the deployment as a resource request of the form "cpu: <value>m".
  requestCPUm: 500

  # LimitCPUm is the CPU limit for the cluster gateway collector deployment.
  # This value will be embedded in the deployment as a resource limit of the form "cpu: <value>m".
  limitCPUm: 1000

  # MemoryLimiterLimitMiB sets the "limit_mib" parameter in the memory limiter configuration for the collector gateway.
  # This is the hard limit after which a force garbage collection will be performed.
  # Default: 50Mi below the memory request.
  memoryLimiterLimitMiB: 

  # MemoryLimiterSpikeLimitMiB sets the "spike_limit_mib" parameter in the memory limiter configuration.
  # This is the diff in MiB between the hard limit and the soft limit.
  # Default: 20% of the hard limit (soft limit will be 80% of the hard limit).
  memoryLimiterSpikeLimitMiB: 

  # GoMemLimitMib sets the GOMEMLIMIT environment variable value for the collector gateway deployment.
  # This is when the Go runtime will start garbage collection.
  # Default: 80% of the hard limit of the memory limiter.
  goMemLimitMiB:

collectorNode:
  # RequestMemoryMiB is the memory request for the node collector daemonset.
  # it will be embedded in the daemonset as a resource request of the form "memory: <value>Mi"
  # default value is 250Mi
  requestMemoryMiB: 250

  # LimitMemoryMiB is the memory limit for the node collector daemonset.
  # it will be embedded in the daemonset as a resource limit of the form "memory: <value>Mi"
  # default value is 2x the memory request.
  limitMemoryMiB: 500

  # RequestCPUm is the CPU request for the node collector daemonset.
  # it will be embedded in the daemonset as a resource request of the form "cpu: <value>m"
  # default value is 250m
  requestCPUm: 250

  # LimitCPUm is the CPU limit for the node collector daemonset.
  # it will be embedded in the daemonset as a resource limit of the form "cpu: <value>m"
  # default value is 500m
  limitCPUm: 500

  # this parameter sets the "limit_mib" parameter in the memory limiter configuration for the node collector.
  # it is the hard limit after which a force garbage collection will be performed.
  # if not set, it will be 50Mi below the memory request.
  memoryLimiterLimitMiB: 

  # this parameter sets the "spike_limit_mib" parameter in the memory limiter configuration for the node collector.
  # note that this is not the processor soft limit, but the diff in Mib between the hard limit and the soft limit.
  # if not set, this will be set to 20% of the hard limit (so the soft limit will be 80% of the hard limit).
  memoryLimiterSpikeLimitMiB: 

  # the GOMEMLIMIT environment variable value for the node collector daemonset.
  # this is when go runtime will start garbage collection.
  # if not specified, it will be set to 80% of the hard limit of the memory limiter.
  goMemLimitMiB: 
```
