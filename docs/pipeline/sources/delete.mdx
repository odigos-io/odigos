<Info>
  Sources are persistent and decoupled from the workloads they instrument.<br />
  If a workload is deleted without deleting the Source, the Source will resume its effects if the workload is re-created later.

## With Odigos UI

The easiest way to remove a source from Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.<br />
After [installing Odigos CLI](/setup/installation), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the sources page, unselect the workloads / namespace for which you want telemetry collection to be disabled.

## Kubernetes Manifests

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your kubernetes workloads, you can remove a source from Odigos by deleting the Source object, for example:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Run:

    ```shell
    kubectl get sources -n default
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    NAME           WORKLOAD     KIND         NAMESPACE
    source-7sxsb   frontend     Deployment   default
    source-b42rn   inventory    Deployment   default
    source-b7zn9   coupon       Deployment   default
    source-v6sxs   membership   Deployment   default
    source-v9jjw   pricing      Deployment   default
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete source source-7sxsb -n default
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    source.odigos.io "source-7sxsb" deleted
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
