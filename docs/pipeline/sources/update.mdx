## service.name

The `service.name` attribute is a fundamental resource attribute in [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service).<br />
It is required, and is reported in all telemetry data.<br />
It is used to identify the service that emitted a span, metric or log record.

Odigos will automatically populate this attribute based on the name of the workload. If there are multiple containers in the workload, the `service.name` will be set to the container name.

If you want to override the default value, you can also set the `service.name` attribute by adding the `otelServiceName` attribute to an exiting Source, or by creating a `Source` with that attribute:
```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: example-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
  otelServiceName: my-custom-service-name
```

Namespace Sources do not support the `otelServiceName` attribute. If a namespace is instrumented, and a Source for a specific workload is not present, a specific source for that workload will need to be created including the desired `otelServiceName`.

### From Odigos UI


The easiest way to update a source from Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.<br />
After [installing Odigos CLI](/setup/installation), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the sources page, select the source you want to edit and fill in the value for the `service.name` field.
To undo the override, simply erase the value from the `service.name` field.

### Kubernetes Manifest

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your Kubernetes workloads, you can can set the `service.name` attribute by updating the corresponding Source.

For example, to set the `service.name` attribute in telemetry for an existing source:

To get the relevant Source for your workload you can either use:
```shell
kubectl get sources -n <source namespace> \
-l odigos.io/workload-kind=<Deployment/DaemonSet/StatefulSet/Namespace> \
-l odigos.io/workload-name=<Workload name> \
-l odigos.io/workload-namespace=<source namespace>
```

or list the sources in the relevant namespace:

```shell
kubectl get sources -n <namespace>
```

After we have the desired Source we can patch it:

```shell
kubectl patch source/<source-name> -n <namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"otelServiceName":"<serviceName>"}}'
```
