## service.name

The `service.name` attribute is a fundamental resource attribute in [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service).<br />
It is required, and is reported in all telemetry data.<br />
It is used to identify the service that emitted a span, metric or log record.

Odigos will automatically populate this attribute based on the name of the workload. If there are multiple containers in the workload, the `service.name` will be set to the container name.

If odigos fails to set a `service.name`, or if you want to override the default value, you can set it manually for a specific source.

```yaml
odigos.io/reported-name: <your-overwite-service.name>
```

### From Odigos UI


The easiest way to update a source from Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.<br />
After [installing Odigos CLI](/setup/installation), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the sources page, select the source you want to edit and fill in the value for the `service.name` field.
To undo the override, simply erase the value from the `service.name` field.

### Kubernetes Manifest

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your Kubernetes workloads, you can can set the `service.name` attribute by adding an annotation to the workload manifest.

For example, to set the `service.name` for a deployment named `my-deployment`, to a value of `foo` with kubectl, you can run:

```shell
kubectl annotate deployment my-deployment odigos.io/reported-name=foo --overwrite
```

To view the changes, run:

```shell
kubectl get deployment my-deployment -o yaml
```

You should see the following snippet with the annotation in the deployment manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    odigos.io/reported-name: foo
name: my-deployment
```

To undo the override, simply remove the annotation from the workload manifest:

```yaml
kubectl annotate deployment my-deployment odigos.io/reported-name-
```
