The process Odigos takes to instrument workloads is as follows:

## Source object is created

A Source object is required for Odigos to instrumente the workload or namespace, such as:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: foo
spec:
  workload:
    name: myapp
    namespace: foo
    kind: StatefulSet
```

If you expect to see data from a workload but don't, check that the Source object, for example:

```shell
kubectl get sources -n <namespace> -l odigos.io/workload-name=<deployment-name>
```

## Language Detection

After Source object is created for a workload, Odigos will attempt to detect the programming language
of the containers in the workload pods and write the detected language to an `instrumentedapplications.odigos.io` CRD in same namespace.

The resulting language is used to determine which instrumentation to apply.

If your workload is labeled, verify that the `instrumentedapplications.odigos.io` CRD exists:

```shell
kubectl get instrumentedapplications.odigos.io -n <namespace>
```

and that `languages` array contains the expected content.

## Instrumentation Device

Once a supported language is detected and the `instrumentedapplications.odigos.io` CRD is created,
Odigos will wait until a destination is added, and OpenTelemetry Collectors are deployed to the cluster which can receive the telemetry.

To inject the instrumentation agent into pods, Odigos will patch the workload template containers with a resource based on the detected language. It would look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - resources:
          limits:
            instrumentation.odigos.io/go-ebpf-community: "1"
```

The `instrumentation.odigos.io/go-ebpf-community` resource limit instruct Odigos on how to mount the relevant OpenTelemetry agent and environment variables into the container, 
and which processes should be instrumented with eBPF.
