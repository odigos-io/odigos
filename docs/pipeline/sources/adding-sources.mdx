Adding a source to Odigos will enable telemetry collection for it.
You can add specific kuberenetes workloads or a whole namespace as a source.

## With Odigos UI

The easiest way to add a source to Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.
After [installing Odigos CLI](/setup/installation#install-the-cli), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the setup page or the sources page, select the Deployments / DaemonsSets / StatefulSets for which you want telemetry collection to be enabled.

To include all the workloads in a namespace as sources, enable the `Select All` switch in the UI.
To automatically add future new workloads in the namespace as sources, check the `Apply for any future apps` checkbox.

## Kubernetes Manifests

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your kubernetes workloads, you can add a source to Odigos by creating a Source object, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: example-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
```

The above Source object enables instrumentation for a Deployment named `frontend` in the `default` namespace.

Note that only one Source object may exist for a given workload, except in namespace instrumentation.

To enable instrumentation for all the workloads in a namespace, create a Source object for that namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: namespace-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: default
    namespace: default
    kind: Namespace
```

Namespace Sources must have both `spec.workload.name == spec.workload.namespace` and `spec.workload.kind: Namespace`.

You can have a namespace Source and a workload Source that both technically enable instrumentation for a workload. In this case, if one is deleted, the other will persist instrumentation for the workload. This can also be used to exclude specific workloads from namespace instrumentation by setting `disableInstrumentation: true` on the workload Source. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: namespace-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: default
    namespace: default
    kind: Namespace
---
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: example-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  disableInstrumentation: true
  workload:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
```

In this example, all workloads in the `default` namespace will be instrumented except for the `frontend` Deployment. If `example-source` is deleted (or `disableInstrumentation` is set to `false`), the `frontend` Deployment will be instrumented.

All Sources will automatically have 3 labels applied by a mutating webhook in the Instrumentor:

* `odigos.io/workload-name`
* `odigos.io/workload-namespace`
* `odigos.io/workload-kind`

The value of these labels will be validated to always match the corresponding fields in `spec.workload`. They can be used to group and list Sources, for example:

```shell
kubectl get sources -l odigos.io/workload-kind=Deployment
```

This will list all Sources for Deployments.

Even when using the UI to instrument applications, the Odigos control plane will create Sources under the hood.

## Removing a Source

To remove a source from Odigos, and stop telemetry collection for it, delete the source from Odigos UI, or delete the Source object for that workload/namespace.

Sources are persistent and decoupled from the workloads they instrument. If a workload is deleted without deleting the Source, the Source will resume its effects if the workload is re-created later.
