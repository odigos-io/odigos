Adding a source to Odigos will enable telemetry collection for it.
You can add specific kuberenetes workloads or a whole namespace as a source.

## With Odigos UI

The easiest way to add a source to Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.
After [installing Odigos CLI](/setup/installation#install-the-cli), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the setup page or the sources page, select the Deployments / DaemonsSets / StatefulSets for which you want telemetry collection to be enabled.

To include all the workloads in a namespace as sources, enable the `Select All` switch in the UI.
To automatically add future new workloads in the namespace as sources, check the `Apply for any future apps` checkbox.

## Kuberenets Manifests

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your kubernetes workloads, you can add a source to Odigos by adding the following label to the kubernetes manifest of the workload:

```yaml
odigos-instrumentation: enabled
```

For example to enable instrumentation for a deploymen named `my-app`, you can run this kubectl command:

```shell
kubectl label deployment my-app odigos-instrumentation=enabled
```

To enable instrumentation for all the workloads in a namespace, you can add the label to the namespace manifest:

```yaml
kubectl label namespace my-namespace odigos-instrumentation=enabled
```

To exclude a specific workload from telemetry collection, even when it's namespace is labeled for instrumentation, add the following label to the workload:

```yaml
odigos-instrumentation: disabled
```

## Removing a Source

To remove a source from Odigos, and stop telemetry collection for it, delete the source from Odigos UI, or remove the `odigos-instrumentation` label from the workload or namespace manifest.
You can always re-enable it later by adding the label back.
