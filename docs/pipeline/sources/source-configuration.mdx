## service.name Attribute

The [`service.name` resource attribute](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service) is a required and fundamental info that is reported in all telemetry data.
It is used to identify the service that emitted a span, metric or log record for useability in most observability tools.

Odigos will automatically populate this attribute based on the name of the Deployment / DaemonSet / StatefulSet. If there are multiple containers in the workload, the `service.name` will be set to the container name.

If odigos fails to set a `service.name`, or if you want to override the default value, you can set it manually for a specific source.

### From Odigos UI

Open the sources page in Odigos UI, select the source you want to edit and fill in the value in the `Override service.name` field for this source.

To undo the override, simply erase the value from the `Override service.name` field.

### Kubernetes Manifest

You can also set the `service.name` attribute by adding the `otelServiceName` attribute to an exiting Source,
or by creating a `Source` with that attribute:

```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: example-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
  otelServiceName: my-custom-service-name
```

For example, to set the `service.name` attribute in telemetry for an existing source:

```shell
kubectl patch source/<source-name> -n <namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"otelServiceName":"<serviceName>"}}'
```

Namespace Sources do not support the `otelServiceName` attribute. If a namespace is instrumented, and a Source for a specific workload is not present, a specific source for that workload will need to be created including the desired `otelServiceName`.
