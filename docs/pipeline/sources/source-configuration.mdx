## service.name Attribute

The [`service.name` resource attribute](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service) is a required and fundamental info that is reported in all telemetry data.
It is used to identify the service that emitted a span, metric or log record for useability in most observability tools.

Odigos will automatically populate this attribute based on the name of the Deployment / DaemonSet / StatefulSet. If there are multiple containers in the workload, the `service.name` will be set to the container name.

If odigos fails to set a `service.name`, or if you want to override the default value, you can set it manually for a specific source.

### From Odigos UI

Open the sources page in Odigos UI, select the source you want to edit and fill in the value in the `Override service.name` field for this source.

To undo the override, simply erase the value from the `Override service.name` field.

### Kubernetes Manifest

You can also set the `service.name` attribute by adding an annotation to the workload manifest:

```yaml
odigos.io/reported-name: <your-overwite-service.name>
```

For example, to set the `service.name` attribute in telemetry for a deployment named `my-deployment`, to a value of `foo` with kubectl, you can run:

```shell
kubectl annotate deployment my-deployment odigos.io/reported-name=foo
```

Below is a snippet of the deployment manifest with the annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    odigos.io/reported-name: foo
name: my-deployment
```

To undo the override, simply remove the annotation from the workload manifest.
