Attributes Actions are a way to modify the OpenTelemetry data recorded by Odigos Sources, before it is exported to your Odigos Destinations.


### Actions
Odigos comes with a set of sampling actions that you can use out of the box:


- [Add Cluster Info](/pipeline/actions/attributes/addclusterinfo) - Add static cluster-scoped attributes to your data.
- [Delete Attribute](/pipeline/actions/attributes/deleteattribute) - Delete attributes by name from your data.
- [Rename Attribute](/pipeline/actions/attributes/rename-attribute) - Rename attributes by name in your data.
