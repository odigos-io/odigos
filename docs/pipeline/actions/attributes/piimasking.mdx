The "PII Masking" Odigos Action can be used to mask PII data from span attribute values.

### Use Cases

#### Security

- By default, OpenTelemetry should not record PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or sensitive data such as passwords, api tokens, etc. However, if the data is accidentally added to the telemetry signals, or if a manual instrumentation recorded it into an attribute, this action can be used to mask such data.

#### Legal and Compliance

- Ensure compliance with legal and privacy.
    - Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards prohibit logging certain things or storing them unencrypted.


### Mechanism

This action processes a list of PII categories to be masked from the traces. Each PII category is linked to a regex that will be applied to all span attribute values. Any portion of the span attribute values that match the regex will be replaced with `****`, while the rest of the attribute value will remain unchanged.


### Basic Example

The basic example below shows how to configure the Pii Masking action to mask Visa and MasterCard credit card numbers from span attribute values.


Create a file named `piimasking.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: actions.odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: PiiMasking
metadata:
  name: piimasking
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  actionName: "PII Masking"
  piiCategories:
    - CREDIT_CARD
  signals:
    - TRACES
```

Apply the action to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f piimasking.yaml
```

### Full Action Options

The full list of options available for the "PiiMasking" action are:

- `piiCategories` (required): An array of strings representing the PII Category you want to mask.

   The available PII categories are:
  - `CREDIT_CARD` - mask Visa and MasterCard credit card numbers

    <Note> Can't find the PII category you need? Please Contact us and we will add it for you </Note>

- `signals` (required): An array with the signals that the processor will act on (`TRACES`).

- `actionName` (optional): Allows you to attach a meaningful name to the action for convenience. Odigos does not use or assume any meaning from this field.

- `notes` (optional): A free-form text field that allows you to attach notes to the action for convenience. Odigos does not use or assume any meaning from this field.

- `disabled` (optional): A boolean field that allows you to disable the action. When set to `true`, the action will not be executed. The default value is `false`.

### Notes

- This action masks span attribute values by replacing only the sensitive portions with `****`, while leaving the rest of the value intact.
- The regex used for masking are predefined for each PII category and cannot be configured.
- Currently, only trace signals are supported.
- All span attribute values in every span will be examined and masked accordingly.
