## Considerations

<Warning>
  Before enabling **pii masking**, please note the following:
  - This action masks span attribute values by replacing only the sensitive portions with `****`, while leaving the rest of the value intact.
  - The regex used for masking are predefined for each PII category and cannot be configured.
  - Currently, only trace signals are supported.
  - All span attribute values in every span will be examined and masked accordingly.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

**Security**

- By default, OpenTelemetry should not record PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or sensitive data such as passwords, api tokens, etc. However, if the data is accidentally added to the telemetry signals, or if a manual instrumentation recorded it into an attribute, this action can be used to mask such data.

**Legal and Compliance**

- Ensure compliance with legal and privacy.
    - Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards prohibit logging certain things or storing them unencrypted.

## Basic Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure the Pii Masking action to mask Visa and MasterCard credit card numbers from span attribute values.

<Steps>

    Create a YAML file with the following content:

    ```yaml pii-masking.yaml
    apiVersion: actions.odigos.io/v1alpha1
    kind: PiiMasking
    metadata:
      name: pii-masking
      namespace: odigos-system
    spec:
      actionName: PII Masking
      piiCategories:
        - CREDIT_CARD
      signals:
        - TRACES
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Apply the action to the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f pii-masking.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
