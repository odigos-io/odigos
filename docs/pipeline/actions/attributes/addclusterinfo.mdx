The "Add Cluster Info" Odigos Action can be used to add resource attributes 
to telemetry signals originated from the k8s cluster where the Odigos is running.

### Mechanism

This action adds static **OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes** to spans, metrics data points and log records.
It is useful to add cluster-wide attributes to all telemetry signals, we recommend:
- `k8s.cluster.name`: The name of the k8s cluster which can be useful to distinguish between different clusters.
- `deployment.environment`: The environment of the cluster (e.g. `production`, `staging`, `development`, etc).

You can also include any other static value attribute that is meaningful to you like `team.name`, etc.

### Basic Example

The basic example below shows how to insert the `k8s.cluster.name` attribute to all telemetry signals.

Create a file named `insert-cluster-name.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: actions.odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddClusterInfo
metadata:
  name: insert-cluster-name
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  actionName: insert-cluster-name
  clusterAttributes:
    - attributeName: k8s.cluster.name
      attributeStringValue: my-cluster
  signals:
    - TRACES
    - METRICS
    - LOGS
```

Apply the action to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f insert-cluster-name.yaml
```

### Full Action Options

The full list of options available for the "AddClusterInfo" action are:

- `clusterAttributes` (required): An array of attributes to be added to the telemetry signals. Each attribute is defined by the following fields:

  - `attributeName` (required): The name of the attribute to be added to the telemetry signals.

  - `attributeStringValue` (optional): The value of the attribute to be added to the telemetry signals.

- `signals` (require): An array with the signals that the processor will act on (`TRACES`, `METRICS`, `LOGS`).

- `actionName` (optional): Allows you to attach a meaningful name to the action for convenience. Odigos does not use or assume any meaning from this field.

- `notes` (optional): A free-form text field that allows you to attach notes to the action for convenience. Odigos does not use or assume any meaning from this field.

- `disabled` (optional): A boolean field that allows you to disable the action. When set to `true`, the action will not be executed. The default value is `false`.

### Notes

- This action is meant to be used for **static** attributes that are known in advanced. It is not suitable for dynamic attributes that need to be extracted from an api or calculated at runtime.
- Some destinations may require specific configuration to index resource attributes and make them available for querying. Please refer to the documentation of the destination you are using for more information.
- If the attribute already exists in the telemetry signal, the value will be overwritten by the value provided in the action.
- An empty string is a valid value for the `attributeStringValue` field
