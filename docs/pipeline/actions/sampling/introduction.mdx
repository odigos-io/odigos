Sampling Actions allow you to configure various types of sampling methods before exporting traces to your Odigos Destinations.


### Actions Scope Categories


Odigos Sampling actions are divided into three main categories, each representing the action's scope. The action scope defines the range that the sampler covers. The categories are:

1. **Global Actions**: These actions sample all data without specificity. All traces flowing through Odigos will be sampled regardless of their source. For example, ErrorSampler.
2. **Service Actions**: These sample actions are applied only to traces coming from a specified service.
3. **Endpoint Actions**: These sample actions are applied to traces coming from a specific service and a specific endpoint. For example, LatencySampler.

### Relation Between Actions

When multiple sampling actions are configured, the most specific rule applies. For example:

- If two rules are configured: an Endpoint action for `Service: Frontend, Endpoint: /buy` with a latency threshold of 1 second and a fallback of 50%, and a Global ErrorSampler with a fallback of 20%:

  1. Error traces will always be sampled due to the Global ErrorSampler, regardless of any Service or Endpoint rule.
  2. Traces from `Frontend /buy` below 1 second latency will fall under the Endpoint action's fallback and retain 50% of these traces.
  3. Traces from `Frontend /buy` above 1 second latency will always be retained.
  4. Any other non-error traces that are not from `Frontend /buy` will be sampled at 20%. 

Each rule ensures you get the specified sampling behavior for your conditions.

### Actions

Odigos comes with a set of sampling actions that you can use out of the box:

- [Probabilistic Sampler](/pipeline/actions/sampling/probabilisticsampler): Add a random sample of your data based on a specified probability.
- [Error Sampler](/pipeline/actions/sampling/errorsampler): Sample traces with status code ERROR.
- [Latency Sampler](/pipeline/actions/sampling/latencysampler): Sample based on the duration of a trace.
