The "Pii Masking" Odigos Action masks span attribute values that match a blocked value list.

### Use Cases

- Prevent sensitive fields from accidentally leaking into traces
- Ensure compliance with legal, privacy, or security requirements


### Mechanism

This action receives a list of all the attributes you want to mask.

### Basic Example

The basic example below shows how to configure the Pii Masking action to mask any Credit Card numbers in the traces.

```yaml

Create a file named `piimasking.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: actions.odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: PiiMasking
metadata:
  name: piimasking
  namespace: odigos-system
spec:
  actionName: piimasking
  piiCategoryConfigurations:
    - mask: true
      category: CREDIT_CARD
  signals:
    - TRACES

```

Apply the action to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f piimasking.yaml
```

### Full Action Options

The full list of options available for the "Redaction" action are:

- `blocked_values` (required): Which values of attribute do you want to redact, it is written as regex. Example - "4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?" is a regex for Visa credit card number.

- `signals` (required): An array with the signals that the processor will act on (`TRACES`).

- `actionName` (optional): Allows you to attach a meaningful name to the action for convenience. Odigos does not use or assume any meaning from this field.

- `notes` (optional): A free-form text field that allows you to attach notes to the action for convenience. Odigos does not use or assume any meaning from this field.

- `disabled` (optional): A boolean field that allows you to disable the action. When set to `true`, the action will not be executed. The default value is `false`.

### Notes

- Currently supports only traces.
- All attributes value in the trace will be masked.
