## Rule Types:

- [Code Attributes](/pipeline/rules/codeattributes)
- [Headers Collection](/pipeline/rules/headerscollection)
- [Payload Collection](/pipeline/rules/payloadcollection)

## Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ruleName">
    **ruleName** `string` : Allows you to attach a meaningful name to the rule for convenience and documentation.
    - This field is *optional*
    - <AssumeNoMeaning />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="notes">
    **notes** `string` : Allows you to attach notes regarding the rule for convenience.
    - This field is *optional*
    - <AssumeNoMeaning />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="disabled">
    **disabled** `boolean` : Allows you to temporarily disable the rule, but keep it saved for future use.
    - This field is *optional*, and defaults to `false`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="workloads">
    **workloads** `{ namespace; name; kind; }[]` : Allows you to apply/limit the rule to specific workloads. If not specified, the rule will be applied to all workloads.
    - This field is *optional*, and defaults to `nil` (all workloads)
    - <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" color="red" /> Empty array will make the rule ineffective
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="namespace">
        **namespace** `string` - The name of the Kubernetes namespace.
        - This field is *required*
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="name">
        **name** `string` - The name of the Kubernetes workload.
        - This field is *required*
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="kind">
        **kind** `string` - The kind of the Kubernetes workload.
        - This field is *required*
        - Supported values: `Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, `StatefulSet`
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="instrumentationLibraries">
    **instrumentationLibraries** `{ name; language; spanKind; }[]` : Allows you to apply/limit the rule to specific instrumentation libraries. If not specified, the rule will be applied to all instrumentation libraries.
    - This field is *optional*, and defaults to `nil` (all libraries)
    - <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" color="red" /> Empty array will make the rule ineffective
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="name">
        **name** `string` - The unique name of the instrumentation library.
        - This field is *required*
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="language">
        **language** `string` - The programming language of the instrumentation library.
        - This field is *required*
        - Alphabetical, lowercase, and no spaces
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="spanKind">
        **spanKind** `string` - The span kind of the instrumentation library.
        - This field is *required*
        - Supported values: `client`, `server`, `producer`, `consumer`, `internal`
      </Accordion>

## Apply to Sources

Odigos allows you to apply/limit rules to specific sources.

- To apply a rule to all sources, omit the `workloads` field.
- To apply a rule to specific sources, provide an array of workload objects (identified by it's namespace, name, and kind).

<Info>
  Odigos allows you to define multiple rules, and will merge them together to create a single rule per source. Conflicting options will be resolved by choosing to record the attribute, if it's specified by one rule (at least).
</Info>

## Apply to Instrumentation Libraries

Odigos allows you to apply/limit rules to specific instrumentation libraries.

- To apply a rule to all instrumentation libraries, omit the `instrumentationLibraries` field.
- To apply a rule to specific instrumentation libraries, provide an array of instrumentation libraries (identified by it's unique name, language, and span kind for golang).

<Info>
  Any rule for a specific instrumentation library will take precedence over a rule that does not specify a library.
</Info>
<Tip>
  This is an advanced feature. It is recommended to set the same rules for all instrumentation libraries, and only use this feature when you need fine-grained control.
</Tip>
