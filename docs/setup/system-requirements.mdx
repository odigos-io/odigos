## Kubernetes Version

Odigos requires Kubernetes version 1.23.0 or higher.

<KernelVersion />

**What to expect if some nodes don't meet the Kernel requirement:**

- eBPF Agents: If a node's kernel version is below 5.4.0, eBPF-based data collection will not be applied to workloads on that node. An error will appear in the UI for any source running on unsupported nodes, indicating that instrumentation was not possible.
- Non-eBPF Agents: Non-eBPF-based agents are not affected by kernel version requirements and will run and instrument workloads on any Linux version.

This allows users to maintain observability on nodes that meet the requirements without needing to upgrade all cluster nodes immediately.

## Kubernetes Cluster Types

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)
- [K3s](https://k3s.io)
- [Red Hat OpenShift](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/675201b3ade18c062e2efc0b) (see [how to install on OpenShift](/setup/installation-options#openshift-installation))
- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service)

## Resource Requirements

To achieve its functionality Odigos uses a set of Deployments and Daemonsets.

### Cluster

The following components runs as Deployment and request the following resources **(per pod)**:

| Component Name | Memory Request | Memory Limit | CPU Request | CPU Limit |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| odigos-autoscaler      | 64Mi         | 512Mi       | 10m       | 500m     |
| odigos-instrumentor (2 replicas)       | 64Mi         | 512Mi       | 10m       | 500m     |
| odigos-schedualer      | 64Mi         | 512Mi       | 10m       | 500m     |
| odigos-ui | 64Mi         | 512Mi       | 10m       | 500m     |

The resource requirements can be configured using [size profiles](/profiles/available-profiles#resource-sizing-profiles) (`size_xs`, `size_s`, `size_m`, `size_l`). The values shown above are for the default `size_s` profile.

In addition, Odigos deploys OpenTelemetry Collector Deployment, 
with auto scaling (multiple replicas) and configurable resources requests and limits.
The default values (unless overridden) are:

| Component Name | Memory Request | Memory Limit | CPU Request | CPU Limit |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| odigos-gateway      | 300Mi         | 300Mi       | 150m       | 300m     |

For more details on configuring resource requirements, see:
- [Resource Sizing Profiles](/profiles/available-profiles#resource-sizing-profiles)
- [Pipeline Configuration](/pipeline/configuration)

### Per Node

2 Daemonsets are deployed on each node in the cluster and consumes resources as follows:

- **odiglet** - Does not set requests and limits. it will consume resources as needed depending on the number of pods running on the node and the amount of data being recorded.
- **odigos-data-collection** - cpu and memory limits and requests are set by default to:

| Component Name | Memory Request | Memory Limit | CPU Request | CPU Limit |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| odigos-data-collection | 150Mi         | 300Mi       | 150m       | 300m     |

These values can be adjusted using [size profiles](/profiles/available-profiles#resource-sizing-profiles) or by providing a custom configuration in the [pipeline configuration](/pipeline/configuration).
