## Choosing target applications

You should now see the following page:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ui_choose_apps.png" alt="Select applications" />
</Frame>

Select all the applications in the `default` namespace and click `Next`.

<Note>
  Selecting **Apply for future apps** will automatically generate distributed
  traces for any application that will be deployed on that namespace in the
  future.
</Note>

## Configuring a destination

In the next step, you will be asked to select a destination for your traces. We support over 70+ destinations, but for the simplicity of this tutorial we will simply click on **Odigos**.

</Frame>

**That's it!** You can click `done` and finish the journey. Odigos will instrument your selected applications and deploy the nessesary OpenTelemetry collectors.

You will be redirected to an overview of your observability pipeline:
