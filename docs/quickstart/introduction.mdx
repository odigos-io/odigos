In this tutorial we are going to use Odigos for generating distributed traces for a microservices-based application written in Go, Java, Python, .NET and Node.js.

We are going to deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster and use [Odigos](/backends/odigos) as the backend for storing and visualizing the traces.

<Info>
 This guide is designed for:

- IT professionals with experience in system administration or DevOps
- Software engineers familiar with containerization and Kubernetes concepts
- Anyone comfortable with command-line interfaces and basic cloud infrastructure

If you're new to these concepts or prefer a more detailed, step-by-step approach, we recommend starting with our [Beginner's Guide to Odigos Installation](https://docs.odigos.io/quickstart/installation-guide-for-beginners).

## Preparing the environment

### Creating a Kubernetes cluster

This first step is to create a Kubernetes cluster.
We recommend using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) for trying Odigos out in a local environment.

<Warning>
  **Mac users**: please avoid using Docker Desktop built-in Kubernetes cluster
  as it [does
  not](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation)
  support bind propagation.
</Warning>

Create a new local Kubernetes cluster, by running the following command:

  <Tab title="Kind">

    ```bash
    kind create cluster
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Minikube">

    ```bash
    minikube start
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Deploying applications

First, we're going to install Odigos's [demo applications](https://github.com/odigos-io/simple-demo) which consist of several microservices written in a variety of languages.

</Frame>

Deploy the applications using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odigos-io/simple-demo/main/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```

### Waiting for the applications to start

Before moving to the next step, make sure that the applications are running, this might take a few minutes.

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=300s deployment --all --all-namespaces
```

Expected result:

```bash
deployment.apps/coupon condition met
deployment.apps/currency condition met
deployment.apps/frontend condition met
deployment.apps/geolocation condition met
deployment.apps/inventory condition met
deployment.apps/membership condition met
deployment.apps/pricing condition met
```
