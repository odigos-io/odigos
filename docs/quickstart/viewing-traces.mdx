**Now that we have some traces, let's view them**!

From the Odigos UI, navigate to the [trace view page](http://localhost:3000/trace-view), and explore the traces:

## Traces Overview

- You'll find a list of traces from the targeted applications:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ui_trace_view_1.png" alt="Trace View 1" />
</Frame>

- You can click the trace-dropdown to expand it's view, and see it's child spans (with context propagation):

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ui_trace_view_2.png" alt="Trace View 2" />
</Frame>

- You can click a span to read it's attributes:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ui_trace_view_3.png" alt="Trace View 3" />
</Frame>

## Traced Error

- Traces that contain errors will be visible as well:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ui_trace_view_4.png" alt="Trace View 4" />
</Frame>

- Clicking the span that contains the error will give you more information:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ui_trace_view_5.png" alt="Trace View 5" />
</Frame>
