Odigos Central is a centralized management layer for multi-cluster observability. Instead of configuring instrumentation, sampling rules, and destinations separately in each Kubernetes cluster, Odigos Central provides a **single pane of glass** to manage all your clusters from one place.

## Why Use Odigos Central?

- **Unified Management** - Configure instrumentation, sampling rules, and observability pipelines across all clusters from a single UI
- **Reduced Operational Overhead** - No need to SSH or `kubectl` into each cluster separately
- **Centralized Access Control** - Manage user authentication and authorization with support for SSO providers like Okta
- **Consistent Configuration** - Apply the same sampling and instrumentation rules uniformly across environments
- **Audit and Compliance** - Single point of control for observability configuration changes
