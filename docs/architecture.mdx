<Note>
  ### Odigos is still in beta 
  
  Some of the features described in this document
  may not be available yet. APIs and custom resources may introduce breaking
  changes.

</Note>

## Goals

Odigos acts as a control plane for all the observability needs in a cluster. It
is responsible for:

- Automatic instrumentation of applications
- Automatic configuration and deployment of collectors
- Infrastructure observability (Kubernetes nodes observability data)

## High Level Architecture

These tasks are performed by following components:

- Instrumentor
- Odiglet
- Autoscaler
- Scheduler
- UI

The different components communicate via Kubernetes API server (see
[Custom Resources](/custom-resources) for more details).

The following diagram shows the architecture of the Odigos observability system.

## Instrumentor

Instrumentor is responsible for automatic detection of
applications in the cluster and providing necessary setup for Odiglet to instrument them. Automatic
instrumentation is done according to the applications selected by the user in
the UI. Instrumentor may change the arguments passed to the instrumentation
SDK to reflect the following changes:

- A configuration change made by the user (for example changing the sampling
  rate in the UI)
- Rescheduling done by the scheduler (when the collectors pipeline changes)

### Odiglet

Odiglet does the heavy lifting of instrumenting the running application.

A key part of being able to automatically instrument every new application is to
be able to detect the language of the application. After the language is
detected Odigos will perform automatic instrumentation according to the
language. For runtime languages Odigos uses the appropriate OpenTelemetry
instrumentation. For compiled languages Odigos uses eBPF instrumentation.

Following heuristics are used to detect the language and the suitable instrumentations
for the application:

- process name,
- the command,
- environment variables,
- dynamically loaded libraries.

## Autoscaler

Autoscaler is responsible for deploying and configuring the collectors.
Deployment of collectors is done in two scenarios:

- A user action in the UI (for example, adding a new destination)
- A change in observabiltiy traffic (for example, if one of the applications
  sends most of the data, the autoscaler may decide to deploy a dedicated
  collector for that application)

## Scheduler

Scheduler service assigns applications discovered by Instrumentor to the
collectors pipeline created by the autoscaler.

## UI

Odigos UI is a Next.js application that allows the user to control their
observability needs. The UI is not accessible outside of the cluster. In order
to access to the UI the user should use port forwarding by executing the
following command:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/odigos-ui 3000:3000 -n odigos-system
```
