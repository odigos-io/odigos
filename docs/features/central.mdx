  **Beta Feature**: Odigos Central is currently in beta. The API and
  functionality may change in future releases.

## What does Odigos Central include?

Odigos Central consists of three main components:

- **Central UI** – A user interface for managing all connected clusters, sources, destinations, and sampling configurations.
- **Central Backend** – The brain of the centralized system; stores configuration and communicates with remote clusters via a proxy.
- **Central Proxy** – A lightweight service deployed in each connected (remote) cluster. It securely forwards requests from the central backend to the local Odigos services (which run without public internet access).

## Why use Odigos Central?

If you're running multiple Kubernetes clusters, Odigos Central helps you:

- Manage instrumentation, sampling, and observability pipelines from one place
- Avoid logging into each cluster separately
- Centralize authentication and access management control

## Getting Started

To get started with Odigos Central, you need to install the central components and configure remote clusters to connect to them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Odigos Central">
    You can install Odigos Central using the CLI or Helm chart.
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="CLI">
        Use the [`odigos pro central install`](/cli/odigos_pro_central_install) command:

        ```bash
        odigos pro central install \
          --onprem-token <token> \
          --central-admin-password <password>
        ```

        This installs:
        - central-backend
        - central-ui
        - redis (for state)
        - keycloak (as identity provider)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Helm">
        You can use the Helm chart to install Odigos Central:

        ```bash
        helm repo add odigos https://odigos-io.github.io/odigos/
        helm repo update
        helm upgrade --install odigos-central odigos/odigos-central \
          --namespace odigos-central \
          --create-namespace \
          --set onPremToken=<token> \
          --set auth.adminUsername=admin \
          --set auth.adminPassword=<password>
        ```

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the Central UI">
    After installation, you can access the Central UI using port-forward:

    ```bash
    odigos pro central ui
    ```

    This will forward the Central UI to `http://localhost:3000` and the Central Backend to `http://localhost:8081`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Remote Clusters">
    To connect remote clusters to your Central deployment, you can use the `odigos config set` command to configure the central backend URL and cluster name:

    ```bash
    # Set the central backend URL
    odigos config set central-backend-url <your-central-backend-url>

    # Set the cluster name for identification in Central
    odigos config set cluster-name <your-cluster-name>
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    # Configure cluster to connect to Central Backend running on port 8081
    odigos config set central-backend-url http://central-backend.example.com:8081
    odigos config set cluster-name production-cluster-1
    ```

    <Info>
      The `central-backend-url` should point to your Central Backend service and must include the port number. If you're using port-forward, this would be `http://localhost:8081`.
