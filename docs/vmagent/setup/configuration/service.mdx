Odigos VM Agent is a PRO feature, and requires a license key which is read from `/etc/odigos-vmagent/service.yaml`.
If you installed odigos with `ODIGOS_ONPREM_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable, the license key should already be set in the file.

The yaml file should contain the following content:

```yaml
on_prem:
  token: "<your-license-key>"
```

To set or update the license key, edit the file and restart the service:

```shell
systemctl restart odigos-vmagent
```

To verify that the license key is set correctly, check the service logs:

```shell
journalctl -u odigos-vmagent
```

The following log message should be displayed if the license key is set correctly:

```
INFO OnPrem token verified aud=<your-organization>
```
