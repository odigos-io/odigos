Trigger the demo application by sending a request to the demo application:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/buy?id=1
```

This call will generate a trace that will be sent to the Jaeger backend.

To view the traces, open http://localhost:16686 in your browser and explore the data. If Jaeger is running on a remote machine, replace localhost with the appropriate IP address.
