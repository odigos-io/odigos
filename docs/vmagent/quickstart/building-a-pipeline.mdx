The default installation only includes a debug destination. This helps you confirm that Odigos can instrument your applications, but it doesn't do much beyond that.

Next, we will set up Odigos to automatically instrument our demo application and send the traces to Jaeger.

Save the following configuration to the file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml`:

```shell
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml <<EOF
sources:
  systemd:
    services:
    - service_name: odigos-demo-membership # go service
    - service_name: odigos-demo-frontend # java service
    - service_name: odigos-demo-inventory # python service
destinations:
- name: demo-jaeger
  type: jaeger
  config:
    JAEGER_URL: localhost:44317
  signals:
  - TRACES
EOF'
```

And reload the agent to apply the new configuration:

```shell
sudo systemctl reload odigos-vmagent
```
