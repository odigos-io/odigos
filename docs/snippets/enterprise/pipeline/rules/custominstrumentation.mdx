## Considerations
If you wish to create custom eBPF-based instrumentations for Go or Java applications, you can define a "Custom Instrumentation" rule via the Odigos InstrumentationRule CRD or the Odigos UI.

This feature is a great way to extend Odigos's auto-instrumentation capabilities to cover your specific use cases and application logic.

## Basic Example

The following example shows how to create a "Custom Instrumentation" rule that instruments a function named `ProcessOrder` in the `github.com/example/ecommerce` package.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Create a YAML file named `custom-instrumentation.yaml` with the following content:
        <Accordion title="Package and function(golang)">
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
        kind: InstrumentationRule
        metadata:
            name: custom-instrumentation-rule
            namespace: odigos-system
        spec:
            ruleName: "Custom Instrumentation for ProcessOrder"
            customInstrumentation:
                golang:
                    packageName: "github.com/example/ecommerce"
                    functionName: "ProcessOrder"
        ```
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Receiver method(golang)">
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
        kind: InstrumentationRule
        metadata:
            name: custom-instrumentation-rule
            namespace: odigos-system
        spec:
            ruleName: "Custom Instrumentation for ProcessOrder Method"
            customInstrumentation:
                golang:
                    packageName: "github.com/example/ecommerce"
                    receiverName: "OrderProcessor"
                    receiverMethodName: "ProcessOrder"
        ```
        </Accordion>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Apply the action to the cluster:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f custom-instrumentation.yaml
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
