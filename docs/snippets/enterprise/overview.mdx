Odigos is an observability control plane. Odigos leverages the power of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and [eBPF](https://ebpf.io) to automatically instrument applications.

Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors according to the traffic of applications. No need to waste time deploying and configuring collectors.

<Tip>
  The name Odigos originates from Greek, meaning "guide".

## Goals

- **Automatic instrumentation** - Odigos automatically instruments your applications and produces distributed traces and metrics **without any code changes**.
- **Collector management** - Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors according to application traffic. No need to spend time deploying and configuring collectors.

Odigos achieves it's goals by deploying a set of components that work together to collect, process, and export telemetry data.

## Who is Odigos for?

- Software Developers
- Platform Engineers
- IT Professionals
- Anyone comfortable with command-line interfaces and basic cloud infrastructure

<Info>
  Odigos is designed to be easy to use and deploy. It is a great tool for anyone who wants to get started with observability without the hassle of setting up and managing collectors.

## Adopt OpenTelemetry in minutes

Odigos currently supports all the popular managed and open source [destinations](./backends-overview). By producing data in the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) format, Odigos can be used with any observability tool that supports OTLP and allow you to easily switch to another vendor in the future.
