Odigos exports data to Google Cloud Storage in [OTLP format](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).
Data can be exported either in JSON format or in binary format (protobuf).

Authentication to Google Cloud Storage is done using [Google Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production).
