## Finding the Current Version

```shell
odigos version
```

Will print the version of the CLI tool and the version of odigos that is currently installed in the active cluster.

## Upgrading Existing Odigos Installation with CLI

First, upgrade the CLI tool to latest version:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew">
    If you are on MacOS, you can install Odigos CLI using Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install odigos-io/odigos-cli/odigos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub Releases">
  1. Download the Latest Version: Head over to the [Odigos GitHub Releases](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/releases) page and click on the latest version available. You’ll see a list of files—choose the one that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

  2. Extract the Downloaded File: Once the file is downloaded, it will likely be in a compressed format like `.zip` or `.tar.gz`. To use the program, you’ll first need to extract (or unzip) it. Right-click on the file and select "Extract Here" or use a similar option, depending on your operating system.

  3. Move the File to a Folder in Your `PATH`. You’ll need to move this file to a folder where your computer looks for programs, known as your "PATH".

   - For Windows: Move the extracted file to a folder like `C:\Windows\System32` or any folder listed in your system’s PATH. You can find out where by typing echo `%PATH%` in Command Prompt.

   - For macOS/Linux: Move the file to a folder like `/usr/local/bin/` or `/usr/bin/`, both of which are common folders included in the PATH. You can check your PATH by opening the terminal and typing `echo $PATH`.

  4. Verify It’s Working: Once the file is in the correct folder, open a terminal or command prompt and type the name of the program (e.g., odigos). If it runs, you’ve successfully installed it! If not, double-check that you moved the file to a folder included in your PATH.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
1. Download the Latest Version: Go to the [Odigos GitHub Releases](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/releases) page. Look for the latest version and download the file that matches your system (typically, this will be a `.zip` file for Windows).

2. Extract the Downloaded File: Once the download is complete, locate the `.zip` file in your Downloads folder. Right-click on it and choose "Extract All." Select a location on your computer where you'd like to save the extracted files.

3. Move the Binary to a Folder in Your PATH: Windows has specific folders where it looks for programs to run, called the "PATH". To make Odigos work from anywhere on your system, you’ll need to move the program (binary) into one of these folders. Here’s how:

   - **Option 1**:
     Move the file to a folder already in the PATH, such as `C:\Windows\System32`. Simply drag the extracted file (often named something like `odigos.exe`) into that folder.

   - **Option 2**:
     Add the folder containing the extracted binary to your PATH manually:
     1. Right-click the **Start** button and select **System**.
     2. Click **Advanced system settings** on the left.
     3. In the **System Properties** window, click **Environment Variables** at the bottom.
     4. In the **System Variables** section, scroll down and find the variable named `Path`. Select it and click **Edit**.
     5. In the **Edit Environment Variables** window, click **New**, and then add the folder where you saved the extracted file.
     6. Click **OK** to close all windows.

4. Verify Installation: Open the **Command Prompt** by searching for `cmd` in the Start menu. Type the name of the program, like `odigos.exe`, and press Enter. If the program runs, then you’ve successfully installed it. If it doesn’t, double-check that you either moved the file to a folder in your PATH or correctly added the folder where the file is located.
