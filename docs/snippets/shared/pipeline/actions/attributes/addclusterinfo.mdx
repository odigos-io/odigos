## Considerations

<Warning>
  Before enabling **add cluster info**, please note the following:
  - This action is meant to be used for **static** attributes that are known in advanced. It is not suitable for dynamic attributes that need to be extracted from an API or calculated at runtime.
  - Some destinations may require specific configuration to index resource attributes and make them available for querying. Please refer to the documentation of the destination you are using for more information.
  - If the attribute already exists in the telemetry signal, the value will be overwritten by the value provided in the action.
  - An empty string is a valid value for the `attributeStringValue` field
</Warning>

## Configuration Options

The AddClusterInfo action is configured using the `odigos.io/v1alpha1.Action` CRD with the `addClusterInfo` configuration section.

You can include any static value attribute that is meaningful to you, like `team.name` etc.

<Tip>
  We recommend:
  - `k8s.cluster.name`: The name of the k8s cluster which can be useful to distinguish between different clusters.
  - `deployment.environment`: The environment of the cluster (e.g. `production`, `staging`, `development`, etc).
</Tip>

## Basic Example

The following example demonstrates how to insert the `k8s.cluster.name` attribute to all telemetry signals using the new Action CRD.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a YAML file with the following content:

    ```yaml insert-cluster-name.yaml
    apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Action
    metadata:
      name: insert-cluster-name
      namespace: odigos-system
    spec:
      actionName: insert-cluster-name
      signals:
        - TRACES
        - METRICS
        - LOGS
      addClusterInfo:
        clusterAttributes:
          - attributeName: k8s.cluster.name
            attributeStringValue: my-cluster
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Apply the action to the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f insert-cluster-name.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
