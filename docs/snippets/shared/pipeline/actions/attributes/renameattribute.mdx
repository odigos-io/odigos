## Basic Example

The following example demonstrates how to rename the deprecated `net.peer.address` attribute to stable `network.peer.address` in all telemetry signals using the new Action CRD.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a YAML file with the following content:

    ```yaml rename-net-to-network.yaml
    apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Action
    metadata:
      name: rename-net-to-network
      namespace: odigos-system
    spec:
      actionName: Rename network attributes
      signals:
        - LOGS
        - METRICS
        - TRACES
      renameAttribute:
        renames:
          net.peer.address: network.peer.address
          net.local.address: network.local.address
          net.peer.ip: network.peer.address
          net.host.ip: network.local.address
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Apply the action to the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f rename-net-to-network.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
