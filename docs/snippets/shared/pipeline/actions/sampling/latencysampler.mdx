## Considerations

<Warning>
  Before enabling **latency sampler**, please note the following:
  - Supports only traces.
  - Multiple `endpoint_filters` can be configured within the same action.
  - Adding this action causes a 30-second delay in sending the data.
  - Traces with durations exceeding 30 seconds might not be sampled correctly.
</Warning>

## Use Cases

**Cost Reduction**

- In large-scale systems, collecting every trace can be expensive. Latency policies allows you to focus on the most critical traces, reducing the overall volume of data sent for analysis. This helps you optimize your costs.

**System Optimization**

- Removing short traces allows you to concentrate on the more important and interesting long traces, optimizing your system for efficiency without being overwhelmed by the volume of trace data.

## Configuration Options

The LatencySampler action is configured using the `odigos.io/v1alpha1.Action` CRD with the `samplers` configuration section.

              <Accordion title="service_name *">
                **service_name** `string` : The rule applies to a specific service name. Only traces originating from this service's root span will be considered.

              <Accordion title="fallback_sampling_ratio *">
                **fallback_sampling_ratio** `string` : Specifies the percentage of traces that meet the service/http_route filter but fall below the threshold that you still want to retain. For example, if a rule is set for service A and http_route B with a minimum latency threshold of 1 second, you might still want to keep some traces below this threshold. Setting the ratio to 20% ensures that 20% of these traces will be retained.

<Info>
  The duration is determined by looking at the earliest start time and latest end time of a trace. Configuring `minimum_latency_threshold` for a specified `service` and `http_route` will sample any request with a duration exceeding this threshold for that particular `service` and `http_route` combination.

  Otherwise, the trace will be dropped. It is recommended to still keep a portion of these traces using the `fallback_sampling_ratio` setting. This allows you to retain a specified percentage of traces that fall below the threshold.
</Info>

## Basic Example

The following example demonstrates how to sample all traces with a latency greater than 1000ms for the `frontend` service and `/buy` http route. Additionally, it retains 20% of the traces that fall below the 1000ms threshold using the new Action CRD.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a YAML file with the following content:

    ```yaml latency-sampler.yaml
    apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Action
    metadata:
      name: example-latencysampler
      namespace: odigos-system
    spec:
      actionName: "example-latencysampler-action"
      signals:
        - TRACES
      samplers:
        latencySampler:
          endpoints_filters:
            - service_name: "frontend"
              http_route: "/buy"
              fallback_sampling_ratio: 20
              minimum_latency_threshold: 1000
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Apply the action to the cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f latency-sampler.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
