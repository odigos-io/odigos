## High Level Architecture

</Frame>

The Odigos Pipeline is composed of the following components:

- **Instrumentations** - code that records OpenTelemetry signals from your application. It can be code in your application native programming language or eBPF programs that record OpenTelemetry data from the linux kernel.
- **OpenTelemetry SDK** - a library that runs in each instrumented process. It receives the OpenTelemetry data from instrumentations and export it out of the process boundary.
- **Node Collector** - also referred to as `data-collection collector`. Each node in the cluster runs a single instance of this OpenTelemetry collector (DaemonSet). It receives the OpenTelemetry data from the OpenTelemetry SDKs, process it, and exports it to the next component in the pipeline.
- **Cluster Gateway Collector** - a collector that runs as a k8s Deployment. It receives the OpenTelemetry data from the Node Collectors, process it, and export it to the next component in the pipeline.

## Component types:

- **Kubernetes Operators** - reconcile the desired state of cluster resources and deploy / configure the necessary components.
- **DaemonSets** - perform node-level tasks, such as interacting with a process running on the node OS, accessing the Kubelet, and reading logs from the node filesystem.
- **Deployments** - run cluster-level components like the OpenTelemetry Collector and the Odigos UI.

## Component Segments

Odigos is divided into three main segments:

- Instrumentation
    - Inject OpenTelemetry agents to collect the instrumentation data from Odigos sources (instrumented applications)
    - Record and report runtime information from the process environment that is relevant to instrumentation
    - Export collected telemetry to the pipeline.

- Pipeline
    - Offload common or heavy tasks from the instrumented application runtime
    - Apply Odigos Actions on the telemetry data
    - Batch and send the telemetry data to the configured destinations

- Odigos Management
    - orchestrate the pipeline and the instrumentation based on the user's configuration and cluster state,
    - provide a UI for the odigos control plane.

## Pipeline

### Auto Scaler (Pipeline Manager)

**Type**: Auto scaler is a Kubernetes operator<br />
**Role**: The auto scaler component is responsible for managing the OpenTelemetry Collectors which implement the OpenTelemetry pipeline.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get deployments -n odigos-system odigos-autoscaler`

- Start and stop Collectors when needed (e.g. when sources or destinations are added or removed).
- Schedule the node collector to start only after the cluster collector is ready.
- Generate the configuration for the Collectors based on Odigos sources, destinations, and Actions.

### Cluster Collector (Gateway Collector)

**Type**: Cluster collector is a deployment of the OpenTelemetry collector<br />
**Role**: The cluster collector receives and processes all telemetry collected in the cluster, applies Actions, and exports data to the configured destinations.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get deployments -n odigos-system odigos-gateway`

- Batch telemetry data for better performance and export it to the configured destinations
- Modify the telemetry data based on the Odigos Actions.
- Apply tail sampling based on the Odigos Actions to reduce the volume of data sent to the destinations.
- Collect metrics about the entities and report it to the UI for monitoring.
- Offload tasks from the agents, to reduce the overhead on the workload runtime environment
- Centralize any common processing that can be shared across multiple agents.

### Node Collector

**Type**: Node collector is a daemon set and will run one pod per node in the cluster<br />
**Role**: The Node Collector (in the context of Pipeline component) receives telemetry data from agents running on the node, enriches it with node-level attributes, and forward it efficiently and reliably to the cluster collector.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get daemonsets -n odigos-system odigos-data-collection`

- Receive telemetry data from agents running on the node (Odiglet for eBPF based agents, and instrumentation processes for native OpenTelemetry agents).
- Add node-level attributes to the telemetry data (`k8s.node.name`, cloud attributes, etc).
- Batch and send telemetry data to the Cluster Collector, offloading any network overhead from the instrumented application runtime.

<Info>
    The Node Collector is also responsible for recording some k8s metrics, and collecting the generated logs from the node fs. Read more Under the [Instrumentation](#node-collector-2) section.

## Instrumentation

### Instrumentor (Auto Instrumentation Agent Manager)

**Type**: Instrumentor is a Kubernetes operator<br />
**Role**: The Instrumentor is responsible for managing auto instrumentation agents which collect telemetry data from Odigos sources.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get deployments -n odigos-system odigos-instrumentor`

- Create and manage `instrumentationconfig.odigos.io` objects
    - Trigger Odiglet to inspect runtime information of workloads.
    - Trigger Scheduler to deploy the Odigos pipeline.
    - Merge Odigos instrumentation rules and config to a workload scope configuration for the agent.
- Inject the instrumentation device into the workload manifest resource as virtual device.
- Monitor the `source.odigos.io` CRD and cleanup any instrumentation related resources when a source is removed.

### Odiglet

**Type**: Odiglet is a daemon set and will run one pod per node in the cluster<br />
**Role**: Odiglet sets up the node environment to run telemetry collection agents.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get daemonsets -n odigos-system odiglet`

- Inspect container runtime details of instrumented sources (to determine programming language, relevant environment variables, runtime versions, etc).
- Implement the Kubernetes virtual instrumentation devices. In the presence of a supported device on the pod, Odiglet will mount the agent code from file system to the pod and add the relevant environment variables to initiate instrumentation.
- For eBPF-based instrumentation, Odiglet will inject the eBPF code into the pod, pick up telemetry from eBPF, and push it downstream to the Node Collector.
- Monitor for config changes to instrumentations and update the relevant agents accordingly at runtime.

### Node Collector

**Role**: Node collector (in the context of instrumentation) is responsible for scraping Kubernetes metrics, and collect logs from the node filesystem.

- When a metrics destination exists, the node collector will use the OpenTelemetry Collector ["kubeletstats receiver"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kubeletstatsreceiver) to scrape k8s related metrics from the Kubelet and export them as OpenTelemetry metrics to the cluster collector.
- When a logs destination exists, the node collector will use the OpenTelemetry Collector ["filelog receiver"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver) to read the relevant pod logs from the node filesystem and export them as OpenTelemetry logs to the cluster collector.

## Odigos

### Odigos UI

**Type**: Odigos UI is a web application backed by a deployment in the cluster and accessible by the user's browser.<br />
**Role**: The Odigos UI is a web application that allows users to configure various aspects of the Odigos installation.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get deployments -n odigos-system odigos-ui`

- Serve as web server for the Odigos UI
    - Serve static files to the frontend
    - Provide a GraphQL API for the frontend, which in turn interacts with Kubernetes API to manage the Odigos installation.
- Provide a user interface for monitoring and managing the Odigos installation, including the sources, destinations, actions, and instrumentation rules.
- Examine the current state of Odigos and show any errors.

### Scheduler

**Type**: Scheduler is a Kubernetes operator<br />
**Role**: The scheduler is responsible for managing the Odigos installation itself.<br />
**K8s Resource**: `kubectl get deployments -n odigos-system odigos-scheduler`

- Monitor the Odigos sources and destinations to trigger deployment of the Odigos pipeline.
- Reconcile Odigos configuration to run validations, set defaults, and apply Odigos Profiles (configuration presets) to the cluster.
