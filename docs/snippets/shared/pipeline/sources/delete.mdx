<Info>
  Sources are persistent and decoupled from the workloads they instrument.<br />
  If a workload is deleted without deleting the Source, the Source will resume its effects if the workload is re-created later.
</Info>

## With Odigos CLI

The Odigos CLI supports instrumenting and uninstrumenting workloads with the [`odigos sources enable`](/cli/odigos_sources_enable)
and [`odigos sources disable`](/cli/odigos_sources_disable) commands.

Each of these commands accepts a source type, name, and namespace.

For example, to remove a source from odigos, run:

```shell
odigos sources disable deployment <deployment-name> -n <deployment-namespace>
```

This command will rollout existing pods to restart without any odigos additions.

It can be undone (re-instrumented) by running: "

```shell
odigos sources enable deployment <deployment-name> -n <deployment-namespace>
```

## With Odigos UI

The easiest way to remove a source from Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.<br />
After [installing Odigos CLI](/setup/installation), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the sources page, unselect the workloads / namespace for which you want telemetry collection to be disabled.

## Kubernetes Manifests

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your Kubernetes workloads, you can remove a source from Odigos by deleting the Source object, for example:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Run:

    ```shell
    kubectl get sources -n default
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    NAME           WORKLOAD     KIND         NAMESPACE
    source-7sxsb   frontend     Deployment   default
    source-b42rn   inventory    Deployment   default
    source-b7zn9   coupon       Deployment   default
    source-v6sxs   membership   Deployment   default
    source-v9jjw   pricing      Deployment   default
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete source source-7sxsb -n default
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    source.odigos.io "source-7sxsb" deleted
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
