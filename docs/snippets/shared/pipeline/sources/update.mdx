Beyond just enabling or disabling instrumentation, Source objects can be used to configure instrumentation settings as well.

All Source settings can be configured with the Odigos CLI (see [CLI documentation on updating Sources](../../cli/odigos_sources_update)) or Kubernetes-native tools like `kubectl`.

## service.name

The `service.name` attribute is a fundamental resource attribute in [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service).<br />
It is required, and is reported in all telemetry data.<br />
It is used to identify the service that emitted a span, metric or log record.

Odigos will automatically populate this attribute based on the name of the workload. If there are multiple containers in the workload, the `service.name` will be set to the container name.

If you want to override the default value, you can also set the `service.name` attribute by adding the `otelServiceName` attribute to an exiting Source, or by creating a `Source` with that attribute:
```yaml
apiVersion: odigos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Source
metadata:
  name: example-source
  namespace: default
spec:
  workload:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
    kind: Deployment
  otelServiceName: my-custom-service-name
```

Namespace Sources do not support the `otelServiceName` attribute. If a namespace is instrumented, and a Source for a specific workload is not present, a specific source for that workload will need to be created including the desired `otelServiceName`.

### From Odigos UI


The easiest way to update a source from Odigos is to use the Odigos UI.<br />
After [installing Odigos CLI](../../setup/installation), run the following command to start the Odigos UI:

```shell
odigos ui
```

And then, in the sources page, select the source you want to edit and fill in the value for the `service.name` field.
To undo the override, simply erase the value from the `service.name` field.

### Odigos CLI

To set the `service.name` using the Odigos CLI, use the `odigos sources update` command ([see documentation](../../cli/odigos_sources_update)).

If you know the name of the Source object to update, pass that to `odigos sources update` along with the `--otel-service` flag:

```shell
odigos sources update <mysource> --otel-service=my-service-name -n <namespace>
```

If you don't know the name of the Source object to update, you can provide flags to `odigos sources update` to identify the Source by workload:

```shell
odigos sources update --workload-kind=<Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet> \
--workload-name=<my-workload> \
--workload-namespace=<namespace> \
--otel-service=my-service-name
```

### Kubernetes Manifest

If you prefer to use kubectl or GitOps to manage your Kubernetes workloads, you can can set the `service.name` attribute by updating the corresponding Source.

For example, to set the `service.name` attribute in telemetry for an existing source:

To get the relevant Source for your workload you can either use:
```shell
kubectl get sources -n <source namespace> \
-l odigos.io/workload-kind=<Deployment/DaemonSet/StatefulSet/Namespace> \
-l odigos.io/workload-name=<Workload name> \
-l odigos.io/workload-namespace=<source namespace>
```

or list the sources in the relevant namespace:

```shell
kubectl get sources -n <namespace>
```

After we have the desired Source we can patch it:

```shell
kubectl patch source/<source-name> -n <namespace> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"otelServiceName":"<serviceName>"}}'
```

If you don't know the name of a Source object (such as when a Source
is automatically created by instrumentation done via the UI), you can
combine the use of Source labels with the `kubectl patch` command. For
example:

```shell
kubectl patch source \
$(kubectl get source -l 'odigos.io/workload-name=<workloadName>,odigos.io/workload-kind=<Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet>' --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name") \
--type=merge \
-p '{"spec":{"otelServiceName":"<serviceName>"}}'
```
