## Required Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your project by running:

```bash
gem install opentelemetry-sdk
```

## Creating a Span

To acquire a tracer:

```ruby
# If in a Rails app, this lives in config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb
require "opentelemetry/sdk"

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.service_name = '<YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>'
end

# 'MyAppTracer' can be used throughout your code now
MyAppTracer = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.tracer('<YOUR_TRACER_NAME>')
```

To create a new span:

```ruby
require "opentelemetry/sdk"

def do_work
  MyAppTracer.in_span("do_work") do |span|
    # do some work that the 'do_work' span tracks!
  end
end
```
