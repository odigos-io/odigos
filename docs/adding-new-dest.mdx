title: "Adding New Observability Destination"
---

There are tens if not hundreds of different observability destinations. Odigos
goal is to provide a seamless and easy way to ship observability data to any one
of them.

In this guide, you will learn how to contribute a new destination to Odigos. We
will create a new dummy destination called `mydest`. Creating a new destination
involves two steps:

1. Extending the UI for the new destination
2. Adding the collector configuration for the new destination

## User Interface

For our new destination to be visible in the UI, we need to make several changes
to the UI code:

1. Go to `destinations/logos/` directory and add your logo file, for example
   `mydest.svg`. Please use svg format for the logo.
2. Go to `destinations/data/` directory and create a new file called `mydest.yaml` by duplicating one of the others.
  That file makes setup page for set destination available and is quite self-explanatory to use:

```yaml mydest.yaml
apiVersion: internal.odigos.io/v1beta1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  type: mydest
  displayName: My Destination
  category: managed
spec:
  image: mydest.svg
  signals:
    traces:
      supported: true
    metrics:
      supported: true
    logs:
      supported: false
  fields:
    - name: MYDEST_URL
      displayName: URL
      componentType: input
      componentProps:
        required: true
    - name: MYDEST_REGION
      displayName: Region
      componentType: input
      componentProps:
        required: true
    - name: MYDEST_API_KEY
      displayName: API Key
      componentType: input
      componentProps:
        type: password
        required: true
      secret: true
```

## Collector Configuration

Now that our new vendor can be persisted/loaded in the Kubernetes data store, we
need to implement the collector configuration.

1. Go to `common/dests.go` and add your new destination to the `DestinationType`
   enum. Make sure the value is the same as the `type` property of the
   destination UI class - `mydest` in the current case.
2. Go to `autoscaler/controllers/gateway/config` directory and create a new file
   called `mydest.go` with the following content:

```go mydest.go
package config

import (
  "errors"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/odigos-io/odigos/common"
)

const (
  regionKey = "MYDEST_REGION"
  urlKey    = "MYDEST_URL"
  apiKeyKey = "MYDEST_API_KEY"
)

type MyDest struct{}

func (m *MyDest) DestType() common.DestinationType {
  // DestinationType defined in common/dests.go
  return common.MyDestDestinationType
}

func (m *MyDest) ModifyConfig(dest ExporterConfigurer, currentConfig *Config) error {
  config := dest.GetConfig()
  apiKey, exists := config[apiKeyKey]
  if !exists {
    return errors.New("My Destination API key(\"MYDEST_API_KEY\") not specified, MyDest will not be configured")
  }

  region, exists := config[regionKey]
  if !exists {
    region = "us"
  }

  endpoint, exists := config[urlKey]
  if !exists {
    endpoint = fmt.Sprintf("https://%s.mydest.com:4317", region)
  }

  // to make sure that the exporter name is unique, we'll ask a ID from destination
  exporterName := "otlp/mydest-" + dest.GetID()
  currentConfig.Exporters["otlp/mydest"] = GenericMap{
    "endpoint": endpoint,
    "headers": GenericMap{
      "x-mydest-header-apikey": apiKey,
    },
  }

  // Modify the config here
  if isTracingEnabled(dest) {
    tracesPipelineName := "traces/mydest-" + dest.GetID()
    currentConfig.Service.Pipelines[tracesPipelineName] = Pipeline{
      Exporters: []string{exporterName},
    }
  }

  if isMetricsEnabled(dest) {
    metricsPipelineName := "metrics/mydest-" + dest.GetID()
    currentConfig.Service.Pipelines[metricsPipelineName] = Pipeline{
      Exporters: []string{exporterName},
    }
  }

  return nil
}
```

- The method `DestType` returns the enum value of the destination added earlier.
- The method `ModifyConfig` is called with the `dest` object which holds the
  data received from the UI and the `currentConfig` object. The `currentConfig`
  object contains the current configuration of the gateway collector. Modify
  this object to include the
  [OpenTelemetry configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/)
  needed by your destination. Make sure to give any exporter or pipeline a
  unique name in order to avoid conflicts (use the convention
  `traces/<dest-name>-<dest.GetID()>` for traces pipelines and `otlp/<dest-name>-<dest.GetID()>` for
  OpenTelemetry exporters). You can assume a basic configuration is already
  provided in the `currentConfig` object, for details see `getBasicConfig`
  method in `common/config/root.go` file.
- You can use the utility methods `isTracingEnabled`, `isMetricsEnabled` and
  `isLoggingEnabled` to determine which signals are selected by the user for the
  destination and configure the collector accordingly.
- The last step is to register the new destination struct in the
  `common/config/root.go` file:

```go
var availableConfigers = []Configer{/* List of existing destinations  */, &MyDest{}}
```

That’s it! Now you can use your new destination in the UI and send data to it.

**Please submit a PR to the
[odigos git repository](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos), we are happy to
accept new destinations.**
